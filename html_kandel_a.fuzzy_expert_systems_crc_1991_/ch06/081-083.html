<P>Fifth generation computer systems present new challenges that go beyond the realms of hardware and software to the process of human reasoning and its underlying logical and philosophical foundations.<SUP><SMALL>13</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>This new generation of computers will have two main distinctive features:<SUP><SMALL>34</SMALL></SUP> they will be based on knowledge processing rather than on information processing, and they will offer natural human-computer interfaces. The success of the expert systems endorses these objectives.<SUP><SMALL>13,38</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>This new approach puts human reasoning in the focus of both the design and application of fifth generation computer systems, and triggers two new questions of major importance:<SUP><SMALL>13</SMALL></SUP></P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we have an adequate theory of knowledge on which to base knowledge processing systems?
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we have an adequate theory of human psychology and brain physiology on which to base human-computer interface design?
</DL>
<P>For more than 2000 years man has tried to find the basic operation of thinking and has privileged logic.<SUP><SMALL>12,13</SMALL></SUP> Man started to investigate the function of his brain 150 years ago and has discovered that learning is not only dependent on logic but also heuristic. Physiology and psychology have stressed the importance of knowledge acquisition based on the repeated observation of the facts, and since Pavlov and Skinner, they have been studying this mechanism<SUP><SMALL>20,28,32,43</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>Expert systems use logic to handle human knowledge, without trying to understand and to model both heuristic and its acquisition. Because of this, the development of an expert system requires a tremendous effort in generating the heuristic of the human expert. It is also a consensus that human expertise is founded over a great number of production rules and/or frames, so that high performance for expert systems can be achieved only on mainframe machines.</P>
<P>Conditioning is the best studied approach for heuristic information acquisition in the case of animals and humans. Besides conditioning, biologists investigate many other processes of behavior modification introduced by repetitive data observation, such as sensory adaptation and message transmission attenuation.<SUP><SMALL>28,29,40,41&#150;43</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>Behavioral modification induced by information repetition will be called here inductive learning, in contrast to deductive learning founded over the process of logical inference.</P>
<P>Behavioral research on conditioning and electrophysiological studies about distribution of the information throughout the brain have demonstrated that learning results in segregation of the information inside reduced brain circuits.<SUP><SMALL>2,43</SMALL></SUP> The idea is that well-learned activities are processed by small neural nets or frames operating a reduced number of almost context-free production rules.<SUP><SMALL>15,43</SMALL></SUP> These conclusions are in conflict with the popular ideas on the AI field, assuming that any reasonable expert machine has to handle at least some hundreds or thousands of production rules and/or frames.</P>
<P>Despite its tremendous success on approaching the process of heuristic acquisition or conditioning, biology is only on its initial steps toward a serious investigation of the deductive or logic process of learning. It has been only recently that the technique to correlate brain activity with complex task processing has been improved.<SUP><SMALL>14,44,45</SMALL></SUP> This technique correlates the brain activity recorded in the electroencephalogram with the understanding and performance volunteers have on cognitive tasks being performed during the recording.<SUP><SMALL>4,17,18,40,49</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>The initial results from these new studies seem to confirm the disposition of man to use a small amount of information to process highly complex tasks such as speech understanding. They do point, however, to fuzzy logic<SUP><SMALL>40,43&#150;45</SMALL></SUP> and expectancy<SUP><SMALL>44</SMALL></SUP> as the important tools improving the human performance of dealing with a particular activity. Expectancy uses previous knowledge to guide goal-oriented processing by favoring previous successful relations.<SUP><SMALL>15,19,21,24,25,33,47</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>General rules may be deduced and formalized from all this knowledge acquired by biology, and they may be used in the development of fuzzy expert systems that will be, at least, much more user friendly, and, for sure, more efficient and compact, too. This chapter will focus its attention on the subject. The formalization summarized here was developed in a series of papers published since 1980. The reader interested in deeper details is referred to these papers, since no attention is presently paid to provide a full description of proofs and concepts.</P>

<P>An expert system is a computer program based on AI techniques; it uses knowledge about a particular domain and reasoning techniques to support those activities performed by human experts.<SUP><SMALL>7,22,48,51</SMALL></SUP> Any person gains expertise through special education and, more important, through special training. Expert systems are believed to obtain this capacity from its interaction with the human expert.</P>
<P>Fuzzy expert systems are proposed to behave more humanlike because they handle concepts and reasoning in the same fuzzy and natural way as the human being does.<SUP><SMALL>46,51,54</SMALL></SUP></P><P><BR></P>
