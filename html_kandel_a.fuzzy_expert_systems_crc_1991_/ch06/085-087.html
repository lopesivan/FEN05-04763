<H3><A NAME="Heading5"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">IV. The Inductive Learning</FONT></H3>
<P>Conditioning is the best-known paradigm to explain the dynamics of neuronal association induced by frequent message pairings. Data association that are frequent strengthen useful neural couplings, inhibit antagonistic actions, and disfacilitate unrelated neural linkages.<SUP><SMALL>40,43</SMALL></SUP> Through these processes, the animals acquire their heuristic knowledge about the external environment, knowledge which is composed of those sets of actions providing the best animal-environment adaptation. Because of this conditioning, it is governed not only by data pairing but also by the success in reaching desired goals.</P>
<P>The stages of high entropy of excitatory neural automata are favored in nonhomogeneous and nonregular environments<SUP><SMALL>43</SMALL></SUP> since the state membership u(q, qh) is strengthened in such conditions. The opposite is true in the case of inhibitory neural automata. Because of this, specific neural nets FG are modeled in the nervous system (NS) by repeated associations of facts. This modeling depends on the relations between the characteristics (<I>j</I>, (r), etc.) of the neurons in NS and the patterns of information present in the specified environment. Goal-oriented development of neural nets is provided by u(sc, sc), since it formalizes the control exercised by NS over both the neural coupling and neural traffic.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">cp (FG) &#8594; 1</P>
<P>for some neural nets, because environmental stimulation approaches the states of their neurons to states of high entropy.<SUP><SMALL>43</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>Heuristic acquisition is governed by the frequency of and the relations established between repeated paired stimuli. In other words, it is guided by the information patterns existing the surrounding environment, which model the nervous systems changing the neuronal coupling. This process is responsible for the heuristic knowledge imprinting during the training of the expert.</P>
<P>Experiments on conditioning, sensory adaptation, and message transmission attenuation, etc.<SUP><SMALL>2,28,32,45,46,49</SMALL></SUP> provide the data necessary to shape (u(t, j), &#197; (r) and u(s, s) and to model inductive learning. Inductive knowledge acquisition, however, is believed to be guided, too, by goal-oriented processes to provide the best adaptation of the animal to the surrounding environment. Experiments on operative and aversive conditioning may provide information about u(sc, sc) necessary to model goal-oriented inductive learning.</P>
<P>It has been demonstrated<SUP><SMALL>45</SMALL></SUP> that as inductive learning progresses:</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of nodes of FG are reduced
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;FG is more likely to be a tree
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Context-free languages are to be handled on FG
<DD><B>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Processing time is reduced
</DL>
<P>because in this condition cp(FG) &#8594; 1.
</P>
<P>Heuristic acquisition is accompanied by the strengthening of neural coupling on specific neural nets<SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP> and the segregation of information inside reduced neural circuits, all of this resulting in brain specialization.<SUP><SMALL>4,21,36,37,44</SMALL></SUP></P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading6"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">V. Knowledge Modeling</FONT></H3>
<P>Learning is the process of abstracting the key features or evidence E related to a proposed question in order to develop a model M to guide the behavior of the system posing the question. The model is a set of relation R (logic or not) between these evidences E:
</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">M = {R = M | R = E}</P>
<P>and has a neural net NG guaranteeing its existence. The functional description F of M is provided by the fuzzy language L (NG) defined over NG. Thus,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">M = {FG, F = L(FG)}</P>
<P>Learned models M must:</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have autonomy (self-reproduction): M must have the capacity to be maintained or to be re-created in NS, providing the substrate for comprehension.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have mobility (exogenous-reproduction): M must have the capacity to be re-created into other neural systems NS, providing the substrate for communication.
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Be generative: M must have the capacity to generate expectancies and predictions about the observed environment E.
<DD><B>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have plasticity: M must have the capacity to generate (to be a germ for) new learnings by posing new questions to the system; the new questions being the result of discrepancies between expectancies or predictions and observations on E.
</DL>
<P>Well-learned or expert models are those realized over neural nets FG for which:
</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">cp (FG) &#8594; 1</P>
<P>Expert models will exhibit low descriptive and high functional complexities<SUP><SMALL>26,39,43,45</SMALL></SUP> since, on the one hand, their FG tends to be trees with a reduced number of nodes and, on the other hand, neurons will be operating at or near their high entropy states. Thus, expert models have strong autonomy, mobility, and plasticity. Also, they have an important capacity of prediction.</P>
<P>If new information is in disagreement with a model Mj, it may reduce cp(FGj) and may increase the coupling power of other models Mk in the complementor net:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">cp(FG)</P>
<P>In such a condition, disagreement and error may trigger a procedure to determine whether a new and more complete model may be developed from Mj or from Mk, which is able to accommodate the new knowledge.<SUP><SMALL>45</SMALL></SUP> This procedure will search for i-cut level sets<SUP><SMALL>35</SMALL></SUP> at FGj or FGj able to maintain the highest possible coupling power and the smallest disagreement with the new data.<SUP><SMALL>45</SMALL></SUP> If this i-cut level set exists, it will be the germ for the development of a new expert model.</P>
<P>Expert models may furnish strong germs for development of new learnings, since their cp(FG)s tend to 1, permitting the search for i-cut level sets enjoying also strong coupling powers.</P>
<P>Expert neural net or the model it represents is built around a basic and highly structured unit or &#147;germ&#148; formed by the most representative and consolidated atoms of the respective knowledge.<SUP><SMALL>44</SMALL></SUP> Other &#147;subnets&#148; are connected to this germ, forming &#147;halos&#148; of weaker and variable associations.</P><P><BR></P>
