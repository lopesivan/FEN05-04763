<P>The purpose of this phase of the investigation is to provide the experimenter with the environment where the population of experts uses its knowledge. The expert applies his knowledge to a specific data population and his knowledge is modeled by the existing patterns in this working environment. This is the basic process of the inductive learning discussed before. For instance, in the case of medical expert systems, this means that it is necessary to know the existing surrounding patterns associated to the diagnosis being studied.
</P>
<P>The same methodology discussed for characterizing the knowledge environment will be used here, the only difference being the fact that the experts will not be asked to organize the data related to the chosen goals, but to allow the experimenter to investigate their professional archives. The purpose of this is to disclose what the data are the experts are using and how they are being organized according to the goals they induced. For instance, in the case of medical expert systems, the experts are requested to allow the experimenters to investigate the profiles of their patients according with their diagnosis.</P>
<P>The same list of generic data (in our case, signal, symptoms, etc.) used in the first phase of the investigation will be applied here, too. The initial step is to translate the contents of the professional (in our case, the medical) record into the same jargon<SUP><SMALL>47</SMALL></SUP> used by the generic data list. If the knowledge engineer does not have a full capacity to understand this professional jargon, he has to be helped by an expert not included in the investigated population.</P>
<P>Once the professional records are translated into a common jargon used by the population of the studied experts, their contents may be described by means of graphs constructed in a similar way the expert model graphs were built in the previous phase of the investigation. The data are ordered according to their appearance in the record under study. The second, third, etc. order nodes, will join this information according to defined syntactic rules similar to the following ones:</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;All data included in a paragraph of the record are joined at a second order node numbered according to the chronological order of the paragraph in the record.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Second order nodes are joined to form the third order nodes according to the segmentation of the record into subsections.
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Third order nodes are grouped according to the segmentation of the record into sections.
</DL>
<P>Once the record graphs are built they will be submitted to the same statistical procedure outlined before to generate the mean graphs. This will generate mean record graphs representing the profile of each chosen goal (diagnosis) in the working environment of the experts.
</P>
<P>The comparison between the mean expert models and the mean record graphs will distinguish the theoretical from the expert knowledge in the studied population of experts. Besides this, and more importantly, the knowledge of the mean record graphs enables the knowledge engineer to stimulate well-controlled tests to study the expert environment. It permits the study of the behavior of the expert in an &#147;almost real situation&#148;, since it provides a control of the complexity of the furnished information by controlling both data as well as their association on each of the planned tests.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading15"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">C. The Expert Environment</FONT></H4>
<P>Once the working environment has been characterized, the expert environment can be studied through simulation of &#147;real situations&#148; requiring the expert to use his knowledge to reach the chosen goals (or diagnosis).
</P>
<P>The mean record graphs will be used in constructing these real situations, because the experimenter can create &#147;testing&#148; records by supplying quantitative data to quantitative variables, as well as to deleting or adding qualitative data to the mean record graphs. Also, the complexity of the real situation can be controlled by modifying data association on the testing records. Task difficulty can be increased by partially merging the contents of two or more mean record graphs. The advantage of the present approach is to provide the knowledge engineer with a full control of the complexity of the experiment.</P>
<P>The testing records will be presented to the same population of experts studied on the previous phases of the investigation. They will be presented in a base of &#147;case exercise&#148;; that is to say, after receiving the information, the expert has to point out the goal supported by the data, as well as to pick the information he used out of the testing records, and to organize it as he assumed these pieces of knowledge need to be correlated to induce (trigger) the chosen goal (diagnosis). The same procedure used to construct the expert model and record graphs will be used here to generate &#147;case&#148; record graphs.</P>
<P>Once case record graphs are obtained for different goals and different experts, they undergo the same statistical treatment discussed before to generate mean case graphs.</P>
<P>The comparison between these mean case graphs and the corresponding mean expert model graphs will furnish more information to differentiate theoretical from expert knowledge in the studied population. More importantly, it will provide the knowledge engineer with information about the possible relations shared by different expert models, both when antagonistic or cooperative models are concerned. The knowledge engineer will use the conclusions from this study to start the organization of the knowledge space. Here the different expert models are assembled to optimize the association of information and generation of new knowledge. At this very moment, the expert system will enhance its capacity for prediction.</P>
<P>If case reports are presented to the expert having its brain activity monitored by the electroencephalogram, the mean case report graphs may be correlated with this activity as described before. This kind of study opens the frontier to a sound investigation of a physiological and psychological theory of expert knowledge that could be the foundation for the development of a more humanlike software and hardware.</P><P><BR></P>
