<P>One of the results of the message imprinting promoted by inductive learning is that part of the surrounding environment E is represented inside the brain. However, it is not possible to speak about an isomorphism for this representation, even in the case of sensory systems.<SUP><SMALL>44</SMALL></SUP> The principal fact against the idea of an isomorphic representation is the observation that the same information may be represented many times in the nervous system, each time enjoying a different neighborhood and, thus, different relations with other information.<SUP><SMALL>9,44</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>Expert models will be represented many times in the brain, each neural net enjoying a different neighborhood and establishing different associations between models. This cerebral organization optimizes association of information and generation of new knowledge, by creating the background for the establishment of unobserved associations between old models.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading7"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">VI. An Experimental Approach for Deductive Learning</FONT></H3>
<P>Fuzzy set theory now provides the background to bring logic under experimentation at the laboratories of physiology. This approach has been used by us to investigate the brain and logic mechanisms underlying speech decoding.<SUP><SMALL>15&#150;18,44,50</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>The brain activity evoked by a particular task may be recorded in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Its statistical analysis furnishes the key elements to the understanding of the involved cerebral processing if the results are correlated with behavioral components of the task under investigation. In the case of language perception, this means that it is necessary to correlate the EEG activity during the decoding of the verbal information with its comprehension. A good picture of verbal comprehension may be obtained from its recall. Hence, it is necessary to correlate the statistical analysis of the EEG recorded during the verbal decoding with a statistical analysis of the recall of this verbal information.</P>
<P>The recall of a listened or read text may be described by fuzzy graphs having the recalled phrases as their terminal nodes and their nodes associated in the same way the subject organizes the text information to conclude for its main subject or theme.<SUP><SMALL>15,16,18,50</SMALL></SUP> The mean graph associated to the &#147;mean decodification&#148; of the text in a given population is dependent on the frequency of phrases, nodes, and nodes associations in the recalled graphs of this population.</P>
<P>The logic structure of the text decodification is obtained asking the volunteer to assign to each node of the graph the logic operator he assumes to be the best one used for the deduction of the chosen theme.</P>
<P>There is a clear distinction between language as a set of symbols and meanings shared by a population, and speech as the use of this language to vehiculate personal &#147;senses&#148; in this society.<SUP><SMALL>27</SMALL></SUP> As a matter of fact, each text may be viewed as a partially closed structure<SUP><SMALL>47</SMALL></SUP> depending, on the one hand, on meaning, guaranteeing a minimum coherence among the symbols used and, on the other hand, on sense permitting people to speak about individual ideas and models. Each piece of information has a correlation with the structure of the text used to convey the desired information or sense, and it triggers a confidence on it at the receiver.</P>
<P>Logic operators at each node, therefore, have to handle two different sets of truth.<SUP><SMALL>17</SMALL></SUP> One of them relates the information represented at the node to the structure of the text itself, and the other associates the same information with the set of beliefs of the receiver. The first of these values will be called correlation and the other will be referred to as confidence.</P>
<P>The concept of &#147;importance&#148;, &#147;relevance&#148;, or &#147;correlation&#148; was introduced in the expert system Centaur,<SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP> and it is used by others<SUP><SMALL>22,51</SMALL></SUP> to differently weigh the contributions of each piece of information in the evaluation of the frame or diagnostic. The concept of &#147;confidence&#148;, &#147;uncertainty&#148;, etc. was used by Mycin.<SUP><SMALL>48</SMALL></SUP> and it is introduced in many expert systems to equip them with a computational capability to analyze the transmission of uncertainty from the premises to the conclusion and associate the conclusion with what is commonly called a certainty factor.<SUP><SMALL>54</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>To investigate both the concept of correlation and confidence, the volunteers are divided in two experimental groups, each one of them working one of these fuzzy values. The rest of the experimental paradigm is maintained the same. A recorded text is played to the subject both with and without having his brain activity registered in the electroencephalograph. After this listening session, the volunteer is asked to recall the text in written form and to point out its theme. The next step is to order the phrases of the recalled text according to the importance they have to the definition of the chosen theme. These ordered phrases are considered as the terminal nodes of the decoding tree, and the subject is asked to join them in the same way he believes he joined the same pieces of information to conclude the theme. After the graph is completed, the volunteer assigns to each node his evaluation of the confidence or correlation shared by the information represented at that node. The final step requires the subject to choose one of the logic operators <I>or</I>, <I>and</I>, <I>not</I>, and <I>if</I> as the operator used to combine information at the node.</P>
<P>Confidence and correlation are averaged for each node of the calculate mean tree as well as for its corresponding logic operator. Linear correlations between these true values and their position in the tree are investigated to assess any dependence of these values on the structure of the text. The correlation between the true values handled by each operator is studied for both confidence and correlation in order to investigate whether the physiological rules<SUP><SMALL>16&#150;18</SMALL></SUP> are the same as the proposed classical ones.<SUP><SMALL>52</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>The association of the most frequent logic operators to the tree representing the &#147;mean comprehension&#148; of the text, and the assignment of the calculated confidence and correlation mean values to each node of this tree, complete the description of the text decodification in the studied population.</P><P><BR></P>
