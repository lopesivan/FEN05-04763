<P>The proposed paradigm is now being applied to model the expert knowledge on congenital heart diseases. Twenty experts and twenty general practitioners from different regions of Brazil are involved in the project. The general practitioners act as a control to characterize the change in information representation induced by expertise.
</P>
<P>The generic data list was prepared from a list of signals, symptoms, and subsidiary tests being used at the Instituto de Cardiologia, Fundac&#227;o de Cardiologia do Rio Grande do Sul, to codify clinical records on cardiology. The experimenter acquiring the information is a physician trained in cardiology and medical informatics, but is not an expert on congenital cardiac diseases.</P>

<P>The first phase of the investigation or the characterization of the knowledge environment is now being concluded for noncyanotic pathologies. The results briefly presented below are those concerned with interatrial communication (IAC).
</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading17"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">A. The Expert Model of IAC</FONT></H4>
<P>The number of terminal nodes of the IAC expert model graphs averaged 6.3 nodes, this implying that the mean IAC expert graph is composed by six terminal nodes. The probability of these six nodes are from left to right: 100, 90, 85, 80, 78, and 70%, respectively. Second and third order nodes, averaged two and one nodes, respectively. Second order node probabilities (around 60%) are lower than the terminal nodes.
</P>
<P>Experts tended to link the first two left terminal nodes almost directly to the root, saying that they would think about the diagnosis in the presence of only this information. The other terminal nodes are linked to the left data in order to improve certainty about the diagnosis.</P>
<P>The most frequent elements of the generic list on the IAC graph are found in Table 1.</P>
<P>The distribution of this data on the mean IAC expert model was crisp, as demonstrated by the distribution of data on terminal nodes (left column on Table 1). The results also pointed to an increase of fuzziness from the left toward the right nodes. Correlation evaluated by the expert parallel the probability of data on expert IAC graphs.</P>
<P>A striking feature on the expert IAC graphs was the multiple connections of at least node one with other right nodes, reflecting the opinion of the experts that this other information may increase the confidence of a diagnosis triggered by the information at node one. The information at node one could be taken almost as a &#147;synonym&#148; of its associated diagnosis. Because of this, the expert IAC graphs were, in general, a family of trees, each one representing one of the associations between the left and right nodes. The mean number of expert IAC trees was four.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading18"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">B. The General Practitioner Model of IAC</FONT></H4>
<P>The mean number of nodes of the general IAC graphs was 13.5, implying that the mean general practitioner model IAC must have 13 terminal nodes. Second and third order nodes average three and one, respectively.
</P>
<P>Besides the increased number of nodes, the mean general practitioner graph showed a very fuzzy structure, since it was both impossible to easily define node connectivity as well as characterize data distribution over these nodes.</P>
<P>The most frequent data on the general practitioner IAC graphs are found in Table 2.</P>
<P>The data stressed the following difference between the expert and the general practitioner handling IAC:</P>

<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The expert uses reduced and crisp models associated to the diagnosis, whereas the general practitioner is fuzzy and prolix in organizing his reasoning. This confirms the hypothesis that learning shrinks the knowledge representation. In other words, expertise reduces the amount of information and processing necessary to support decision.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The expert uses some data as almost a &#147;synonym&#148; of the goal (diagnosis) to be reached (trigger). The other information is used to strengthen confidence in the decision. This is not the case in the nonexpert, since it always uses all the information available.
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence paralleled use by the expert, but not by the general practitioner.
<DD><B>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts and general practitioners differed on the used information. The expert physician uses clinical data as the most important support for his decision, whereas the general practitioner prefers to base his diagnosis on laboratory tests, whose results are believed to be endorsed by an expert. Thus, the expert prefers to use his expertise on evaluating both the information provided by the patient and, more importantly, the clinical data he observes on physical examination. The general practitioner seems to prefer to use the knowledge of the results of laboratory tests.
