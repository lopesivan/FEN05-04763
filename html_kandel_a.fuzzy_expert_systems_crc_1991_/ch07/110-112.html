<P>There are several significant future contributions which we believe could result from extensions of this effort. A very basic and first part of such efforts should concern the use of very general &#147;value of information&#148; techniques to direct and control the assessment of information, including imperfect information, that is required for judgment and choice. In this, the concern should be developing an inquiry process whereby the queries that best accomplish the objective of inducing a linear order on the set of feasible alternatives will be identified. The knowledge support system to be developed, based on the research accomplished here, would have two major components: a model for the analysis of alternatives and a metamodel for inquiry in charge of directing and controlling the interactive nature of a system that allows adaptation and learning. In effect these will allow for higher level metaknowledge, perhaps represented as formal reasoning-based knowledge, to direct and control the use of skill and rule-based knowledge which will typically be schema-like. Thus, it may be possible to resolve the problem of lower level knowledge explosion which often occurs in an expert system as the accumulation of knowledge, some of which may be inconsistent, leading to an unmanageably large number of rules.
</P>
<P>The research concerning knowledge imperfection provides an approach by which defects in the knowledge base can be identified, avoided, and resolved, but only when it is important that this be done. This may involve or even require a formal scheme to explain to the decision maker, in a suitable way, the nature of information imperfections and the effects that may result from using different techniques to resolve them. This and the results of the portions of the study dealing with knowledge acquisition and representation could lead to the development of information presentation aids for purposes such as training, skill building, and decision making in operational contexts. The operational evaluation study should result in useful information concerning the ubiquity of the knowledge support system concepts being investigated and, hopefully, useful information concerning evaluation procedures for knowledge support systems in general.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading7"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">VI. Potential Applications</FONT></H3>
<P>The development of computerized systems that aid human decision makers in stressful and potentially crisis situations, such as command and control tasks, is a primary need at this time.<SUP><SMALL>16</SMALL></SUP> It is important that decision process modeling be accomplished but that the decision process itself be output oriented, as opposed to process oriented, so that it is driven by the objective of higher quality outputs and not just a better process. Available information, especially in distributed decision situations is imperfect. The concepts described here and more fully developed in the cited references should be applicable to the development of support systems having these characteristics and capabilities. The approach to more effective model base management and knowledge support discussed here should also have ultimate applicability as a training and tutorial aid that provides understanding of the value of information in decision situations.</P>
