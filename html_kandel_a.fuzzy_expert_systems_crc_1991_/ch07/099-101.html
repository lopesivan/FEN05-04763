<P>Structured frameworks for human information processing, associated inference analysis based upon statistical and epistemic reasoning, and realistic algorithms for software realization of support systems were the three primary areas for investigation reported on here. There are many approaches to the processing of information that is, for any of a variety of reasons, imperfect. A recent paper by Stephanou and Sage<SUP><SMALL><SMALL>1</SMALL></SMALL></SUP> summarizes many of these, and a recent monograph<SUP><SMALL><SMALL>2</SMALL></SMALL></SUP> illustrates application of some of these approaches. While many of the recent efforts, including most that appear in this book, are based no fuzzy set theory, here we report on a somewhat different approach to representation and use of imperfect information. The research presented here is intended to integrate, especially in the areas of inference analysis, contemporary approaches in artificial intelligence for expert system construction and management science or systems engineering approaches for the design of decision support systems.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading3"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">II. Background for the Research</FONT></H3>
<P>Our research was concerned with the appropriate use of imperfect information in planning, problem solving, and decision making. By imperfect information, we mean information that is incomplete, imprecise, uncertain, inconsistent, unreliable, or some combination of these. We have been especially concerned in our research with design protocols for knowledge support systems that aid individuals in coping with imperfect information.
</P>
<P>We have been especially concerned with the development of approaches that will cope with evidential or epistemic information as well as with statistical or aleatory information. The latter part of our efforts have concerned initial examination of distributed decision making and the need to acquire, represent, and use imperfect knowledge in forms that are appropriate for group use, where individual members of the distributed group represent a variety of stages of human experiential familiarity with the task at hand and may not necessarily all have access to the same information.</P>
<P>Our work has a basis in, but extends considerably, the decision-making problem with a finite set of possible alternatives in that it considers imperfect knowledge of information about the decision situation structural model that described the task at hand, the impacts of alternative courses of action, and the value perspectives of the decision makers.<SUP><SMALL><SMALL>3</SMALL></SMALL></SUP> Our assumptions of imperfect knowledge of information may refer to available information that may be imprecise, relative to the degree of refinement with which the assessment is made; information that may be inconsistent in the sense of being in disagreement with presumed principles or laws of an assumed decision situation model; or information that may be incomplete in that needed elements are missing. One of the principal purposes to which an operational aid based on these concepts could be put is in the interactive determination of appropriate information requirements for judgment and choice. We wish to deal with information that is statistical and imperfect,<SUP><SMALL>4-6</SMALL></SUP> as well as with information that is epistemic and imperfect.<SUP><SMALL>8-13</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>Several advances associated with the use of formal model-based management efforts are associated with this research. The central issues studied here lie at the interface between the human model and the formal model used to represent a particular judgment situation.<SUP><SMALL>8,14-15</SMALL></SUP> This interface concerns the human information processing activities required for the use of situation frameworks, schemata, or models, and enhancement of the ability of people to organize them in a way that results in an efficient and effective aid for judgment and choice activities, including situation understanding.<SUP><SMALL>16,18</SMALL></SUP> This research is concerned with support for formal knowledge-based reasoning as well as skill-based and rule-based inputs to judgment that are appropriate in situations in which there exists considerable experiential familiarity with a task at hand.</P>
<P>Most contemporary formal models for decision support depend, for their use, on a very organized process to adequately frame the knowledge surrounding an issue. At the representation level, this knowledge is required to be precise relative to the degree of refinement with which the assessment is made, consistent in agreement with principles and laws of the model, and complete in the sense of containing all the information necessary to obtain a linear preference ordering of the alternatives.<SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP> It is often in the real life situation, however, that various parameters of a model for these purposes are unknown. Immeasurableness, or perhaps partial knowledge of the parameters of the model, prevents the wide use of formal models for decision support. Even when sufficient information is gathered, it is not unusual to obtain a recommendation for a best alternative that is unacceptable to the decision maker. A preference order, supplied by a formal model, may not reflect some aspects of the decision maker&#146;s intuitive feelings concerning the situation at hand. In addition, information may be discovered to be self-contradictory after it is interpreted.<SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP> In this circumstance, some aspects of the semantic character of the knowledge structure and information contained in the model of the decision situation have been improperly assessed or represented.</P><P><BR></P>
