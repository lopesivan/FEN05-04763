<P>In cases 1 and 2 the solution results in a set of hierarchically organized linear programming problems. The simplest formulation is that of case 3, which is equivalent to the problems solved by Sarin and Fishburn, resulting in a set of simple linear programming problems. Other approaches have been developed, but they all rely on the existence of additive independence conditions to facilitate the computations.
</P>
<P>Decision-making problems in which there are several conflicting objectives have been formulated in terms of multiobjective programming problems. The mathematical programming formulation of the multiple objective decision problem is</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">max<SUB><SMALL>a</SMALL></SUB> U[u<SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB>(a),u<SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB>(a),&#133;,u<SUB><SMALL>n</SMALL></SUB>(a)]</P>
<P>where the u<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB> are the real-valued utility functions of the n objectives. The single attribute utility functions u<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB> are assumed known; the overall utility function U is unknown. Generally, the solution to this problem is not a unique alternative but a set of nondominated alternatives. Multiobjective programming techniques operate under the notion of dominance for generating the set of nondominated alternatives. Interactive algorithms to gradually gain knowledge about U and solve this problem uniquely have been proposed by many researchers.</P>
<P>Screening procedures can, in general, be made to be interactive. Interactive approaches of this type assume that the decision maker can provide preference information on simple, often hypothetical, alternatives. Initially, a reduction of the nondominated set is made with the available information. If the decision maker can select an alternative from the nondominated set, then the process is stopped. Otherwise, further information is requested. Often, but not always, very little guidance is provided by these procedures about the information needed. The decision maker is asked to provide further information when a single nondominated alternative is not present. This information may be redundant in that the decision model could have inferred it from previous information. In this case it could serve only as a check for consistency. The new information may be inconsistent with the existing information. Alternately, the decision maker may never recognize and provide information needed to reduce the nondominated set. All this may make decision support processes that are based on interactive multiple objective procedures ineffective and inefficient.</P>
<P>The flexibility that the interactive screening, or scanning, procedures provide potentially results in a more effective support process. However, this flexibility complicates, to a considerable extent, the task of the decision analyst as a facilitator. In order to make efficient use of these new screening procedures, it seems necessary to provide the analyst with a suitable dialogue generation and management system. Such a system must be designed with full knowledge of the particular data base and model-based management system used to allow for the interactive dominance-based scanning. At the very least, it is necessary to provide assistance to the analyst in determining what information is most needed, in terms of relevancy to the task at hand and with due consideration being given to information that is both important and cognitively easy to assess. The analyst should be aided in the evaluation of acquired information for consistency and in ways to avoid and resolve inconsistencies that do result. Finally, the information that is acquired must be represented and used within a model-based management system that is valid and appropriate for decision making.</P>
<P>The foundations of multiattribute expected utility theory provide useful models of normative behavior for decision making under risk. The assessment of precise utility functions in these models is mathematically justified by the existence of a real-valued utility function. Whether it is behaviorally justified is yet another question. In addition to the several practical difficulties encountered in assessing precise utilities, there are a number of semantic issues involved with the precise representations of preference judgments. One of the aims of contemporary research is to seek representation that incorporates in complete measurements of preference and risk attitude and to provide a behaviorally meaningful as well as rationally correct approach for decision support. Instead of assessing a real-valued utility function, various &#147;fuzzy&#148; kinds of imprecise and otherwise imperfect representations of utilities and probabilities are allowed.</P>
<P>Procedures for screening multiattribute alternatives with partial information about preference judgments appear to be more behaviorally attractive to decision makers than more precise approaches for decision support such as multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) based models. This is primarily because these procedures require less precise assessments of preference and often reduce the number of assessments needed in order to reach a decision. These characteristics of screening procedures reduce the time and effort demanded from decision makers.</P>
<P>Screening procedures are, in general, interactive. They assume that the decision maker can provide preference information on simple, often hypothetical alternatives. Initially, a reduction of the set of alternatives is sought given the available information. If the decision maker can select an alternative from the reduced set of alternatives, then the process is stopped. Otherwise, additional information is requested until a further reduction of the set of alternatives is achieved.</P>
<P>Very little guidance is provided by these procedures about the information needed. The decision maker is asked to provide any additional information he may know and wish to express about the problem. In some cases, this information may be redundant, meaning that the decision model could have inferred it from previous information; consequently, it could serve only as a check for consistency. It may be inconsistent with the existing information, or the decision maker may never recognize and provide the necessary information to reduce the set of alternatives. All of this may cause the decision process based on interactive screening procedures to be ineffective and inefficient.</P><P><BR></P>
