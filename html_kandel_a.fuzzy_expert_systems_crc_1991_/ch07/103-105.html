<P>Even though the theory and procedures of multiattribute decision analysis are conceptually straightforward, there are other circumstances that make its implementation very complex. Putting the methodology into practice is much more involved than one might believe. Each of the decision analysis steps requires substantial interaction between the analyst and the decision maker. A very stressful thinking process is demanded of the decision maker while the analyst is in charge of coordinating a series of activities in order to facilitate this process. The analyst must obtain the minimum amount of relevant information about the decision problem to determine the various utility functions. Often redundant information should also be obtained in order to check for consistency. It is interesting that in most of the literature on decision analysis, there is little or no mention of the information system functions that need to be accomplished in order for a recommended decision to evolve. In effect, it is assumed that the decision maker is an expert with respect to knowledge of relevant information but is unable to aggregate this information in a proper fashion needed for an effective judgment or decision.
</P>
<P>In the exercise of an effective decision-aiding process, much is required of the analyst. The analyst must be sensitive to biases and flawed heuristics that the decision maker may utilize; the analyst must be able to structure the decision problem regardless of the degree of complexity and, above all, retain the confidence of the decision maker with respect to the belief that a formal analysis of the problem will result in a more intelligent and informed decision.</P>
<P>The large amount and complexity of information required for complete specification of multiattribute utility functions and probabilities lead, especially in practice, to the use of simplified heuristics. Often these are flawed.<SUP><SMALL>2,25</SMALL></SUP> Even in prescriptive or normative situations, screening procedures will often be needed to reduce the time, stress, and effort demanded from decision makers. Screening methods are intended to identify and reduce the size of the nondominated set of alternatives, that is to say those that are not bettered by at least one other alternative on each and every one of the attributes of importance, through use of behaviorally relevant and easily available information. One of the first to develop a screening method for decision making with incomplete knowledge of probabilities was Fishburn.<SUP><SMALL>26,27</SMALL></SUP> He was concerned with the use of incomplete information on probabilities in comparing alternative strategies in a typical formulation of decision making under risk. The criterion of choice or strategy that should normatively be used is the principle of maximum expected utility, so that the decision maker seeks a strategy a* which is the maximum over i of the expected utility of alternatives a<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB>. The utility function U<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>(a<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB>) is a precisely assessed multiattribute utility function defined on the set of possible strategies {a<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB>}, and p<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>(&#183;) is a measure of the likelihood of the possible state of nature j given that a particular strategy was selected. The imprecise forms of the measure of probability that Fishburn considered are</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No information about p<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>(&#183;)
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinal measure: an ordering of p<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>, (e.g., p<SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB> &#8805; p<SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB> &#8805; p<SUB><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUB>)
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Linear inequalities: an ordering of sums of p<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>, (e.g., p<SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB> + p<SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB> &#8805; p<SUB><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUB>)
<DD><B>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bounded interval measure: (e.g., c<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB> &#8804; p<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB> &#8804; c<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB> + d<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB>)
</DL>
<P>The search for the best alternative is, in this approach, performed by pairwise comparisons of expected utility among candidate strategies. Because of the restricted form of the available information on the p<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>, the search for the best alternative can be put, in general, into a straightforward linear programming problem.</P>
<P>Sarin<SUP><SMALL>28</SMALL></SUP> proposed a screening procedure similar to that of Fishburn with the additional assumption of additive independence on the set of attributes. This assumption simplifies the search for dominance structures and results in a procedure which can be formulated as a mathematical programming problem. The parameters of the mathematical programming formulation include probabilities, importance weights, and single attribute utility functions. A simple procedure is then developed for the case when the probabilities and the importance weights are precisely known and utilities are stated in the form of linear inequalities, thereby resulting in simple linear programming formulations. Extensions to this research have been reported by Sage and White<SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP> who develop an <B>A</B>lternative <B>R</B>anking <B>I</B>nteractive <B>A</B>id based on <B>D</B>ominance structural <B>E</B>licitation (ARIADNE) concept. The general mathematical programming formulation of the search for dominance results in the interactive solution of a large number of relatively simple linear programs. Several cases have been considered:</P>

<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The probabilities (p<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>) are known precisely, and the importance weights (w<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB>) and utilities (U<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB>) are described by linear inequalities.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance weights (w<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB>) are known precisely, and the utilities (u<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB>) and probabilities (p<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>) are described by linear inequalities.
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance weights (w<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB>) and utilities (u<SUB><SMALL>i</SMALL></SUB>) are known precisely, and the probabilities (p<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>) are described by linear inequalities.
