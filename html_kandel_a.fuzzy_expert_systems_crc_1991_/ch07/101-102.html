<P>Real life decision problems are so complex, unstructured, and poorly understood initially that a formal process for decision support must allow and encourage learning so that the decision maker gradually obtains increased understanding of the decision situation as well as the personal value perspectives which led to the decision, so as to be able to make a more informed and hence typically better decision. Thus, support to formal-based reasoning results in the learning of rules and ultimately the skills that augment, and perhaps even replace, formal reasoning in later performance of these same tasks.<SUP><SMALL>8,18,19</SMALL></SUP> This appears to firmly introduce skill and rule-based knowledge into the judgment situation and to make it very desirable that formal processes for model-based management and knowledge support incorporate these forms of knowledge. It is particularly important to recognize the possible information imperfections that may surround a decision situation when determining information requirements and requirement specifications for decisions and for designs that result from decisions.<SUP><SMALL>20</SMALL></SUP> In each of these cases, the ability to cope with imperfect information is essential.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading4"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">III. Research Accomplishments</FONT></H3>
<P>An approach that accommodates both probabilistic (or aleatory) and logical (or evidential or epistemic) support, and that is able to cope with several types of imperfect information has been developed. It is important that alternatives to probabilistic representations of knowledge be considered as real information about specific situations that is often more evidential or epistemic than it is aleatory. The principal accomplishments of this research have been the development of a decision-aiding concept that allows processing of information that is imprecise, incomplete, inconsistent, and otherwise imperfect. A structural representation of knowledge is utilized so that the effects of information imperfection are available to the decision maker in the form of information presentation aids displaying the results of information that has been input to the support system up to the present.
</P>
<P>The process results in interactive decision aiding in which the support system user, rather than the dictates of an analysis algorithm, guides the process.<SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP> At any point in time, evaluation of identified courses of action are available that are based on information obtained up to that point in time. This acts as a value of information guide in determining needs for additional information, and in encouraging the system user to not seek information of low saliency or relevancy, or of greater consistency than warranted by the task at hand. The approach appears very capable of implementation on current generation microcomputers, and a realistic effort at implementation, together with extensions to the distributed decision-making case, is suggested as an important, potentially high payoff topic for future research.</P>
<P>We have been concerned with interactive formulation of knowledge support processes as learning processes in which the decision maker, through interaction with the support system, is able to successively gain a better understanding about the decision situation and to adapt judgments accordingly.<SUP><SMALL>8,12</SMALL></SUP> This is accomplished in such a way as to enable selective resolution of inconsistencies in the knowledge base during the search for an appropriate schema representation of knowledge, perhaps in the presently instrumented form of a dominance structure among alternative courses of action, that is sufficient to enable judgment and choice.</P>
<P>This learning aspect of the research was complemented by research efforts associated with knowledge acquisition.<SUP><SMALL>19</SMALL></SUP> One object of knowledge acquisition is to enlarge the knowledge base of a support system with specific new knowledge, perhaps in the form of schemata or productions which might be expressed in terms of rules, contexts, and interpretations. Inconsistency and incompleteness in the knowledge base generally are detected only through the application of concepts that are often not known to the support system at the time the imperfect knowledge is first acquired. Thus, meta-knowledge is essential to construction of a support system. It can be used to prioritize the relevancy of the schema, scripts, or rules in the knowledge base so that those most likely to be useful, given a current state of knowledge on the part of the support system, are used first.</P>
<P>There are several possible criteria for evaluating the correctness, reliability, and operational utility of the results obtained in this research. In the absence of general quantitative criteria to rigorously assess the reliability and operational utility of the results of the proposed work, our evaluation procedure should be based heavily on simulated case studies and operational evaluation based on these. The main criteria that appear appropriate for evaluating the reliability of the conceptual knowledge-based support system developed here include</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The system should be robust relative to performance in the face of missing rules and/or evidence. The performance of the reasoning scheme should &#147;degrade gracefully&#148; by generating less specific conclusions as information is subtracted rather than qualitatively incorrect ones.
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequential knowledge acquisition and information-gathering schemes should also detect significant inconsistencies in the rules and/or evidence, and warn the user of this and possibly other knowledge imperfections. Through this, it should also be possible to measure information and knowledge acquisition cost. This figure of merit reflects the (primarily personnel) costs associated with the knowledge acquisition step of the knowledge support system aiding process.
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancement of decision quality should be measurable in case study comparisons against expert, intermediate, and inexperienced decision makers. Decision quality is a function of the specificity and correctness of the conclusions, as well as of the cost of the information that was required to reach those conclusions.
<DD><B>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Decision-making productivity enhancement should be measurable in case study comparisons.
<DD><B>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A knowledge base updating flexibility measure reflects the cost of updating the knowledge base as rules are added, deleted, or substituted.
