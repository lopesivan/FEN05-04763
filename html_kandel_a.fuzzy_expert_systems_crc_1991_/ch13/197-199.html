<P><B>Outward Movement 8</B> &#151; The ceiling was flat and held up by parallel beams at a distance so that a <I>cotto</I> tile would bridge it, and both beams and tiles had been whitewashed and seemed to be lighted from within, as the shutters were closed. I would hold my right arm high and with my finger write in between the beam lines, as on a page of my notebook. I would spend a lot of time at it, since my discovery of writing was fresh. But this had to be a secret pleasure, because they would laugh and make fun of me if observed.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the reverie came to an untimely end with the secondary process claiming control and starting the organization of the material in its own fashion. It began by abstracting and focusing upon certain associations, to which it then tried to give rational content:</P>
<DL>
<DD>Light &#151; revelation
<DD>Light &#151; painting visible
<DD>Painting &#151; ultimate surrender
<DD>Intimate &#151; secret
<DD>Buried under &#151; depth perception
</DL>
<P>After some conflict, the two processes compromised upon a conviction that a deep enough level of meaning had been reached and a generative kernel established. The secondary process described it like this: a spatial configuration of vaulted spaces within vaulted spaces, a fluid circulation network that would allow short-linked relations among particular objects to be experienced, and a complex use of natural and artificial lighting to allow the individual displayed objects to reveal themselves. The primary process accepted that its qualitative concerns could be so met.
</P>
<P>Eventually an iconic representation was produced that expressed and confirmed visually and globally these certainties. The secondary process would hammer at the representation, again and again, until the generative force of the kernel had found mutually acceptable concretization.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading3"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">II. How Can the Computer Help? What Sort of System Do We Want?</FONT></H3>
<P>Up to this time, computers have been brought into the design process very late in the game, when the most important creative and imaginative work has already been done <I>or omitted</I>. The current use of technology and the current mental set reinforced by the &#147;problem-solving&#148; attitude, make it easy all too often for genuine creativity to be bypassed altogether. The machine lends itself, of course, to utterly explicit and completely algorithmic operations, that is, to be the more superficial levels of the secondary process alone. Emphasis on these tends to obscure the true creative challenge.</P>
<P>We propose to bring the computer <I>within</I> the creative process, as close to the primary process phases as possible. This aim and the consequent systemic structure and content are in sharp contrast with those of existing software.</P>
<P>We are not claiming that a computer system can perform the primary process function. Quite the contrary, we believe these to be beyond mechanistic abilities forever, not only at the present day. What we do seek to provide is a receptor for the fruits of the primary process, which will encourage the designer to confide his fresh ideas and enable him to return to them at will. Positive aid, where the system offers its own suggestions, will be confined to the secondary processes at as deep a level as we can manage.</P>
<P>Ambitious though it is, our object is to facilitate the cooperation of the two processes by providing the following features:</P>
<P><B>Feature 1</B> &#151; In primary receptive mode, the system makes the expression of the ideas evolved by the primary process as undistracting as possible. Confident that his conceptions are accepted as meaningful and valid, the designer is to be spared the superfluous inhibition brought about by a feeling of estrangement from the recipient. The initial global ideas can be expressed to the machine in any combination of three notations, <I>graphic, verbal</I>, and <I>relational</I>, which, by their familiarity, encourage spontaneity. The special handling of each of the three notations, requiring interpretation followed by manipulation, is discussed in the next section.</P>
<P><B>Feature 2</B> &#151; In promoting the secondary process, the system can be used either as an active or a passive agent:</P>
<DL>
<DD>&#149; It will &#147;volunteer&#148; suggestions; that is, having itself performed a version of some of the processing, it can offer the results to the user for acceptance, rejection, or modification.
<DD>&#149; It will, of course, also allow convenient secondary processing entirely on the part of the user.
</DL>
<P>For example, in connection with the enormously important <I>articulation</I> of an initial global vision into, for example, elementary solids, there can be available the system&#146;s own attempts, the designer&#146;s attempts, and any desired synthesis of these.</P>
<P><B>Feature 3</B> &#151; By a rather sophisticated network filing subsystem (part of the <I>relational zone</I> touched upon earlier and to be discussed in the next section), the system facilitates free movement among the growing number of notes and sketches. There also exists alternation between primary and secondary activity on the part of the user who can, without hindrance, drop one of the activities, then resketch, and later tie the new work into the existing network. Fidelity to the first vision (which is the essence of the whole effort) is thus encouraged by the ease with which the later representations can be compared with the earlier ones. If the designer can decide upon <I>labels</I> to give to certain aspects of his conception, which he feels to be essential, the system can even issue reminders of them on subsequent occasions. These arrangements also encourage recourse to primary processing at all the later stages of the designer&#146;s work. These steps are those concerned with such matters as furnishing style, materials of decoration, adjustment of proportions, and, in general, whenever aesthetic considerations enter.</P>
<P><B>Feature 4</B> &#151; A learning component is planned for the system to be installed after an effective working version has first been constructed. Its main function will be to acquaint itself with typical actions of an individual user, and to promote these to prominence in developing its own suggestions. This will diminish the amount of explanation the user must give to the system, as discussed in the next section, and, therefore increase the tranquillity of his or her self-expression. At the same time it will increase the frequency with which the system&#146;s suggestions are agreeable to the user. The effect desired is the emulation of a human assistant who gets to know the idiosyncratic ways of the principal.</P><P><BR></P>
