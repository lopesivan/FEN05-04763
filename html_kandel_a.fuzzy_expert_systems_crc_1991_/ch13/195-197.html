<H3><A NAME="Heading2"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">I. The Creative Design Process</FONT></H3>
<P>When Freud investigated the dynamic unconscious, which predominates in so much of our mental life, he distinguished between the <I>primary</I> and the <I>secondary</I> mental processes. In dreams, the primary process calls up the exciting, bizarrely structured material from the depths of the unconscious, which the secondary process partly resists and partly transforms into what the dreamer perceives.<SUP><SMALL>6</SMALL></SUP> In vision, the primary process seizes the meaningful <I>gestalt</I> of the object it cares about. The secondary process subdivides this and starts to organize the parts into relationships. The meaning of all of this, beyond the merely rational, must again be supplied by the primary process and so on, with many interchanges, as can be traced in Arnheim.<SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>In artistic creation the primary process makes use of loose, undifferentiated structures lacking clear boundaries, failing to distinguish between opposites, and lacking a clear articulation of space and time. It is syncretistic in its grasp of the whole object. The secondary process, on the contrary, aims at well-defined, differentiated structures, abstracts smaller elements from the concrete object, and matches them one by one. It uses an analytic mode. Both are necessary and interactive in the artistic creation but, as has been noted with children, the analytic mode of the secondary process can re-repress the other process, with disastrous consequences.<SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>All creative designing consists of an alternation between these two processes. The primary process turns up imagery from the unconscious, which the secondary process manipulates to make more explicit and analytic. While this is going on, or after it has been completed (often long after), the primary process turns up fresh material. This material is then reworked by the secondary process and, once more, inspiration comes from the primary process, and so on, an indefinite number of times. The alternation between the two creative processes occurs in various rhythms. There is a slow, tidal movement of emphasis from the one to the other and back, and there are rapid, almost undetectable, oscillations.</P>
<P>One of the present authors recollects that, in the midst of dealing with the challenge of designing a museum, he went for a drive through the Tuscan countryside. He experienced a sequence of thoughts, which are excerpted here. It will be apparent, as Freud noted concerning the recital of dreams, that the primary thoughts, when recalled, have already been clothed in words and partially rationalized by the secondary process.</P>
<P><B>Inward Movement 7</B> &#151; The first time I went to the Uffizi (was I 13?), I had no idea what to expect. I was concerned that the owners of the place, who lived there, had all moved out of the rooms temporarily. The pictures seemed to live in a world of their own and, yet, to be quite alert and waiting, as if to resume some intimate conversation with friends. And, yet, they looked like someone one knew going about their lives in workshops or restaurants, except for an air of fancy and unashamed revelation, the more so because some of them lived in my classroom also, but so lifeless there and forlorn, like photographs of dead people. I decided that it must be the building and its immediate surroundings that provided that exalted quality, that heroic surrender.</P>
<P><B>Outward Movement 7</B> &#151; The window reaches the floor and is open. The great thickness of the wall is revealed. The floor is made up of <I>cotto</I>, as at home, except that here it is very smooth and even, and redder. The white heavy cotton curtain moves slightly; the air is still, the light is secret and uneven; the room is large, and the ceiling high. There are three portraits in the room; two of them, on opposite walls, seem to mirror one another as if they were having a dialogue. The ceiling is flat and supported by wooden beams placed at a distance from one another such that a <I>cotto</I> tile, larger than the floor one, spans the interval. The beams are decorated with intricate geometric designs in color. The ceiling enrages me . . . it is all wrong.</P>
<P><B>Inward Movement 8</B> &#151; The white, freshly laundered sheets would be brought in and piled on the bed. After dinner I would pretend to be very sleepy, and would slip in under the white mountain, like crushed sails, smelling of sun and fresh air. Eventually the women would come in and start folding the sheets. They would stand by the side of the large bed, one at each end and, having got hold of the four corners of one, they would throw it up into the air. The sheet would inflate, unruffling, and stand suspended for a moment like a white cupola. I would try to fight off sleep. When properly folded, it would be placed on the other bed, my parents&#146;, in a neat growing pile. Meanwhile, the women would converse softly about secret, terrible, and beautiful happenings in the village, and their muted voices echoed down the cascading corridors of cupolas. When I woke up next morning, I felt a great sense of loss . . .</P><P><BR></P>
