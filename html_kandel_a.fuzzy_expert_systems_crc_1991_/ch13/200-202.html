<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading10"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">F. Matching of the Visual-Formal and the Activity-Functional Structures, and of Both with the Original Conception</FONT></H4>
<P>As the repeated differentiation and refinement of the geometric and the activity structures proceeds (as in Sections C and E), they continually require mutual compliance. The system facilitates constant comparison in adjacent windows, and the annotations attached to the relational representations not only suggest some of the parameters for the readjustments of the geometry, but also demand figuration reflecting important qualities. The system, which never forgets the notation of a requirement, is ready at any time to offer reminders for an evaluation of the results. It can also always run through the successive steps the designer has taken, so that errors of judgment can be corrected.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading11"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">IV. Feasibility and Methodology</FONT></H3>
<P>Clearly, the system discussed here presupposes the existence of present-day, state-of-the-art, three-dimensional CAD systems, notebook systems, and the like, some of which it can utilize. Its chief advance upon them is central: the divorce between the &#147;hot&#148; (primary) and the &#147;cool&#148; (secondary) communication from the user to the computer, and the facilitation of both. All of this is twofold. First, there is the receptivity of the machine to the nonanalytical presentations of the primary process, preserving them, as they first flow, until the user is in the mood to process them secondarily. Second, there is the readiness of the machine to respond to the user&#146;s wishes &#151; to &#147;understand&#148; his or her elaboration and clarification and sometimes to anticipate them. These abilities are those which will give the user confidence and the enlivened feeling of working in a sympathetic medium.
</P>
<P>They can be obtained, in our view, with certain techniques on which much work has been done, but which are only beginning to find their way into general use. These are the <I>fuzzy</I> methods stemming from Zadeh,<SUP><SMALL>17,18</SMALL></SUP> in their relational version.<SUP><SMALL>2,3</SMALL></SUP> Very widely applicable, these methods are particularly appropriate here because of two almost contrasting reasons. Ideas, as well as performance specifications and other parameters of the initial building program and of the initial inspiration can, on the one hand, be left in imprecise form during the early stages of work, awaiting later clarification. On the other hand when, as often happens, they have been prematurely overspecified, they can be varied within wide limits as the design process goes along. Adaptations of one subsystem to another can also be handled by the relational component using fuzzy relational products<SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP> and continuing the fuzzy relational data base technology pioneered by Zemankova and Kandel.<SUP><SMALL>19</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>In what sense is this system more &#147;expert&#148; than what already exists? It is mainly in the interworking between itself and the designer, to whom it seems to be making &#147;efforts&#148; to &#147;understand&#148; what he means before he has made it explicit and, indeed, to assist him in doing so. For the system to deserve this impression requires more than a display of tact on its part. It demands the adroit exploitation of the extensive knowledge base, made possible by the intensive development of the relational component. What we consider to be the core of the design task is the interplay between the primary and the secondary processes. In attempting to promote this interplay, we have had to push the expert system capability beyond what is operationally expected of present day CAD programs, into a realm where the object is no longer constructed by the assembly of parts, but is articulated by the differentiation of a global image.</P>
