<H3><A NAME="Heading4"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">III. The System at Work</FONT></H3>
<P>We have tried to establish as paramount importance that the designer grasps a generative kernel of the design task, which is the grounds for his conviction and security, and, in effect, his knowledge &#151; perceptions, reactions, feelings, and ideas. If and when this finds a syncretistic representation, visual or plastic, it carries great clarity and force; think, for example of Utzon&#146;s famous initial sketch of the Sydney Opera House.
</P>
<P>This is the <I>sine qua non</I> of the design process. From then on we consider the two fundamental stages which have to be reached and reconciled in order to arrive at a successful conclusion. One is the geometric, volumetric, and spatial organization of the proposed artifact: the definition and arrangement of its parts. The other is the explicit elaboration of the structure of the activities which will go on inside the building: this is an aspatial structure, a sort of mirror image of the spatial one. We will refer to the first as <I>geometrization</I>, to the second as <I>expression of the activity structure</I>.</P>
<P>Both are developments of suggestions implicit in the generative kernel of the first expression. Both must, at the end, accord with one another and with the initial vision; only then will they feel right to the designer. &#147;The formal levels ought to represent a system of functional levels,&#148; as Norberg-Schulz<SUP><SMALL>15</SMALL></SUP> puts it.</P>
<P>Let us now examine how our system proposes to assist the designer in achieving these two goals. We assume, without further comment, that it contains sophisticated drafting manipulative software, of the general sort already in existence,<SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP> and we concentrate instead on its innovative features.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading5"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">A. Recording of the Initial Global Vision</FONT></H4>
<P>For completeness, we suppose the designer&#146;s initial idea to be embodied in a sketch, with perhaps a couple of subsketches, a few arrows showing special relationships on the sketches, and all bearing some annotations. This can all be drawn and entered into the machine with light pens on the screen, or on a special tablet, or (experimentally) with a special directly three-dimensional drawing apparatus. To make the entry as unfussy as possible, no extra requirements are put upon the designer, except only that the three kinds of information be kept distinct, for example, by the use of three differently colored pens for the graphic, the verbal, and the relational elements. Transgressions can be cleared up later.
</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading6"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">B. Debriefing Phase</FONT></H4>
<P>The great freedom of the initial entry must be tempered at a later moment by the explanation to the system of some of the entered information. If the sketch was entered to a two-dimensional receptor, then the three-dimensional lie of its strokes will need to be clarified. The relational arrows may need additional labels. The verbal notes will need to be divided into those to be kept verbatim and those subject to semantic interpretation; the latter will need to be re-entered by typing. The nuisance of this phase is mitigated by its postponement from the time of primary entry and also, perhaps, by the fact that, in clarifying things to the system, the user may also be clarifying them to himself.
</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading7"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">C. Geometrization</FONT></H4>
<P>The computer system now has an internal representation, in three dimensions, of the designer&#146;s original sketch. It allows him to divide this into parts, substitute elementary solids for each of these parts, alter their mutual positions, experiment with their proportions and their hierarchical relationships, seek out their symmetries, view them from various angles, and, in general, perform upon them all the usual geometrical transformations and investigations until he reaches a configuration which he accepts.
</P>
<P>If requested, the system will try its own hand at some of this; for example, it can fit one, two, . . . , <I>n</I> elementary solids to the initial or any subsequent sketch. Each such suggestion is subject to the user&#146;s acceptance, rejection, or retainment for modification. Continuing the example, the solids may be taken from a variety of repertories: classical elementary, rectangular parallelipipeds, polyhedra of different sorts, all from simply or multiply parametrized families of the kinds discussed in Mitchell.<SUP><SMALL>14</SMALL></SUP></P>
<P>Of course, as the design advances, the parts themselves require articulation, elaboration, and detailing, to conform with their meaning. The same system facilities can be reapplied but, in addition, there are available the relational ones discussed in the next item.</P>
<P>As always, the assistance is interactive, so that its active and passive uses can be alternated at will.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading8"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">D. Relational Manipulation</FONT></H4>
<P>Whether between parts of the drawings or of the eventual artifact, or between activities of the building&#146;s users, or among properties and qualities of aesthetic, social, functional or psychological nature associated with the project, <I>relations</I> abound throughout the design process. We take the most general case, in which these may be either <I>fuzzy</I> or <I>crisp</I>, and apply very general methods,<SUP><SMALL>2,3,17,18</SMALL></SUP> displaying the results as <I>digraphs</I>, and further manipulating the latter by elaboration of existing methods. This zone of the system has a number of important uses, of which we discuss only one, in the next item.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading9"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">E. Analysis and Expression of the Activity Structures</FONT></H4>
<P>Relations among activities, of whatever sort the designer may be concerned with at the time &#151; contiguity, temporal succession, complementarity, mutual observability or visual exclusion, etc. &#151; lend themselves neatly to representation and manipulation as diagraphs, with prolific annotations. This partial visualization of the activity structures conduces, among other things, to the allocation and mutual arrangement of spaces in such a way as to meet the relational demands. The relational zone of our system supports thinking out the relations in these terms, and adds graph-untangling procedures, dual-graph floor planning, and so forth. In addition, it makes available a library of examples and furnishes continual reminders of the designer&#146;s own notes on qualities and visual features.
