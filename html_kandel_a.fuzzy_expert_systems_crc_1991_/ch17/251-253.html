<H3><A NAME="Heading16"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">VIII. Intervention Module &#151; The Tutor</FONT></H3>
<P>This module performs several complex tasks all geared toward providing individualized and intelligent guidance to the student. Initially, the intervening monitor obtains input from the lesson planner concerning the routine and variations that have been chosen for the lesson plan. There are specific forms of intervention associated directly with specific routines. Also, the monitor obtains information regarding the student&#146;s expected level of achievement for the target skill in order to set an intervention-frequency level. For example, if the student is working toward <I>expert novice</I> mastery, a higher intervention frequency is set than if the student is working toward <I>expert</I>. The tutor also has access to any other information from the SR necessary for this session, such as motivation for this problem type, previous success record, language level (i.e., choice of vocabulary) of prompts, <I>most frequent</I> error-types for this student, etc. Of course, the tutor is able to modify these levels if it decides the current choice is inappropriate.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading17"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">A. Lower Level Errors</FONT></H4>
<P>The monitor observes the user&#146;s progress in performing the lesson&#146;s problem-solving tasks by comparing student responses (using fuzzy production rules) to a tree of all acceptable solution paths generated by the solutions module. By comparing the student&#146;s solution moves to those constituting a solutions tree, the monitor is able to obtain on-line observations of such behaviors as how long the student takes to accomplish various parts of the task (a time measure), how frequently the student alters her response (a certainty measure), as well as correctness in schema choices, operands, operators, path, and memory-management decisions. The specific items of interest vary, depending upon the current performance goal and routine in use. Some of the matching to the tree is direct, for example, determining if the student schema values are identical to those of the tree. However, the decision as to the <I>correctness</I> of the schema labels is a fuzzy decision and is implemented through fuzzy production rules. This approach is consistent with our observations of student protocols that mislabeling is a significant cause of difficulty in problem solving. A particular node in a schema may have several correct as well as incorrect labels, some being <I>more correct</I> than others (see Appendix A, Part 2). Next we discuss other errors.</P>
<P>In developing this module, we conducted studies of the problem-solving errors and developed error categories and their possible causes (see Appendix A). Using these error categories and knowledge of the problem setting in which they occurred, the tutoring of these lower level errors can be implemented in a rather straightforward manner using fuzzy production rules. For example, the tutor has knowledge of the student&#146;s past error patterns, ability level for this problem type, and interruption history, and uses these to select a tutoring response through matching a fuzzy production rule. A typical such rule is (in English):</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>If</B> student <I>often</I> selects wrong___operator <B>and</B> is rather___weak on
<DD>combine___problems <B>and</B> student has not been interrupted
<DD>recently
<DD><B>then</B> suggest [closer___look___at___schema].
</DL>
<P>The actual wording of the instantiated suggestion will vary with the student, her reading level, and other prompts given during this session.
</P>
<P>Tutoring these low level errors is done quite simply with knowledge from the SR and the solutions module. For example, a <I>bad value assignment</I> (see Appendix A) is easily observed from the tree. However, the response will vary with the student and the tutoring strategy for this student. If on the one hand, the student is a <I>very good</I> one, then this is probably simply a slip rather than a conceptual problem. If the tutor does not interrupt, then this is an opportunity for self-monitoring to come into play. If the student does not detect the error, at the end of the solution process the tutor can highlight this subtree and suggest, &#147;Is this step what you intended?&#148; and allow the student to redo the solution. On the other hand, if the student is a <I>very poor</I> one, then the tutoring strategy could be set at a much more intrusive level, for example, &#147;Can Car A stereo plus Car B stereo produce a useful set?&#148; The decision as to what message to give and in what format is the result of executing the most appropriate fuzzy production rule. The inference engine is forward chaining and may adjust its own knowledge depending on the response of the student to these prompts. Counts of the various error types are maintained to be used in matching the fuzzy production rules.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading18"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">B. Executive Skills Error Models</FONT></H4>
<P>The executive skills (e.g., poor memory manager, no self-monitoring) error models are more esoteric and require a more sophisticated approach. It relies on the SR and also on previous psychological analyses of signs of the absence of certain executive level skills.
</P>
<P>Such signs include time between actions, uncertainty, and accuracy of solution. These, when represented in various weighted combinations, indicate the absence or confusion of different executive skills. For example, poor memory management would include longtime spaces when trying to recall an unsaved value (i.e., a large value in the fuzzy [0,1] range), a significant degree of uncertainty in trying to recall a value (for example, selecting a value and then erasing it repeatedly). These combinations give a value in the range [0,1]. Each error model will have a cut-off level. The level itself is variable and is a function of the nature of the problem being solved, how long the student has worked on the problem, how close the student has come to a solution, and the history of interventions for the current problem and session. If the calculated value exceeds this level, we can assume that this error model is representative of the student&#146;s difficulties, and the tutor then applies the corresponding tutoring strategy (previously determined to be the most efficacious for this error model). If no conclusion can be made, then more monitoring is done and the values recalculated.</P>
<P>Some error models have been determined through analysis;<SUP><SMALL>7</SMALL></SUP> we expect to fine-tune these as well as add more. Currently, we are implementing the corresponding production rules with entries which are fuzzy intervals. These are more representative of the uncertainty inherent in executive skills. New error models can be added or inappropriate ones removed simply, as necessary with the object-oriented approach used for the overall design.</P>
<P>The tutoring module provides a novel application for FESs. The significant degree of uncertainty involved in modeling the human mind makes the fuzzy approach not only appropriate but indispensable.</P><P><BR></P>
