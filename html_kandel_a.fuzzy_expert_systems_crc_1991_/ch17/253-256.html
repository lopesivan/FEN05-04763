<H3><A NAME="Heading19"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">IX. Cooperation Between SR and Tutor Fess</FONT></H3>
<P>It is obvious from the description of the SR expert system and the tutor that each depends significantly on the other. In order for the system to achieve its twin goals of individualization and intelligence in tutoring, the SR must feed the tutor its impression of the student and the tutor must return its knowledge of the student&#146;s progress to the SR expert system for evaluation and update. For efficient and real-time execution, these two subsystems must not duplicate their activities. By using a node labeling procedure on the solutions module tree, a succinct graph of nodes visited by the student together with tutoring messages can be passed from the tutor to SR for processing after the session. The SR FES can then do its analysis and updating off-line.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading20"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">X. Conclusions</FONT></H3>
<P>As expert systems move out of the strictly technical and scientific areas into more humanistic fields, the inherent uncertainty in measuring the human mind demands the use of fuzzy techniques. We have demonstrated the efficacy of the fuzzy expert system in the setting of an intelligent tutoring system for arithmetic word problems. As pointed out by Clancey,3 these systems must constantly handle &#147;noisy data, shifting focus of attention, and goals or reasoning strategies that may be foreign to an ideal model of the world.&#148; To deal with these complexities, we feel that future systems have no choice but to incorporate fuzzy expert systems into their designs in order to achieve individualized and intelligent tutoring. We propose that the TAPS system is a first step in that direction.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>DEFINITIONS OF ERROR CATEGORIES AND STUDENT MOVES</B></FONT></P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>BAD VALUE ASSIGNMENT (FOUR TYPES)</B>
<P>Value for set required in solution is incorrect in otherwise correctly labeled scheme.
<DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>Transfer error</B> &#151; Set value is given in problem and entered into solution, but subject makes incorrect transfer into problem solution. This indicates carelessness, lack of self-monitoring, disorganization &#151; general self-monitoring deficit.
<DD><B>Inference error</B> &#151; Set value is not given but can be inferred or easily calculated based on problem information. World knowledge may be required to infer appropriate value. However, value is determined through mental calculation or inference is incorrect and is entered into solution.
<DD><B>Propagation error</B> &#151; Set value entered into solution has been obtained from previous bad schema-based operation (e.g., bad schema, bad calculation).
<DD><B>Others</B> &#151; All others not listed previously are included here.
</DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>BAD LABEL</B>
<P>Schema is correct and present in solution path, but one set is imperfectly or imprecisely labeled, and this leads to problems.
<DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>Imprecise label</B> &#151; For example, instead of labeling a set as &#147;cost of apartment for one month,&#148; the set may be labeled &#147;cost of apartment&#148;. Self-monitoring skills are possibly implicated. This may indicate lack of understanding.
<DD><B>Other</B> &#151; Any labeling problem not covered previously is included here.
</DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>3.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>BAD SCHEMA (FIVE TYPES)</B>
<P>The student constructs a schema that is not on current solution path. Any schema is bad if it has at least one inaccurately labeled set.
<DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>Bad subgoal</B> &#151; The student sets subgoal to compute a set that is not on a current solution path. A <I>correct</I> schema may be formed for the unneeded set. Plan or problem-
<DD>solving strategy may be implicated, as the student has developed a bad goal. The student may not understand the problem.
<DD><B>Irrelevant data</B> &#151; A schema not in solution is constructed because the student has failed to eliminate irrelevant problem information. This may result in extra schema, a hybrid schema that combines irrelevant with valid solution sets, or in the substituting of a wrong for a correct schema. Inability to recognize and eliminate information irrelevant to goal-based plan (planning skill) is implicated. If the student is working forward, he may spontaneously eliminate unnecessary schema at a later point.
<DD><B>Good subgoal</B> &#151; The student clearly has set a good subgoal that is on current solution path and is attempting to calculate that subgoal, but is combining wrong sets for calculating it. This error code may be combined with the type in Part 2, &#147;Other.&#148; Schema knowledge may be implicated &#151; the student does not possess a schema for calculating desired value, or the student might be distracted by irrelevant problem information or just being careless.
<DD><B>Strategy confusion</B> &#151; The student is on one solution path, but then <I>borrows</I> schema that is not on a current solution path but is correct for another one. The student may be changing strategies, or this may be a confusion error. This code is used only when there is confusion between two strategies. The student is having difficulty in developing problem representation and is being distracted by valid alternative schemas that are not on current path. This might be due to a reading error that causes problem to be comprehended incorrectly, or it may indicate that the student is having difficulty with problem-solving strategy.
<DD><B>Other</B> &#151; All schema errors that do not fit clearly in categories described previously are included here.
</DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>4.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>ARITHMETIC ERRORS</B>
<DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>Calculation error</B> &#151; The correct schema and operation are indicated but the student makes an arithmetic error while computing unknown set value. The error may be a decimal error. The error is typically propagated through entire solution. Self-checking and memory-management skills possibly are implicated. In younger children, there is a possibility of an arithmetic bug.
<DD><B>Wrong attachment</B> &#151; Correct schema has been set up but a wrong operator is applied.
</DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>5.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>OMIT ERRORS</B>
<DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>Omit step</B> (schema) &#151; The student is pursuing the correct solution strategy but one schema is omitted. Self-monitoring skills are possibly implicated. Planning skills are implicated in the sense that the subgoal has been left out.
<DD><B>Omit branch</B> &#151; The student omits an entire branch in the problem-solving strategy. This indicates serious comprehension failure and lack of comprehension monitoring. The student has failed to analyze the problem in depth, possibly indicating a lack of effort. The student may sense the answer is wrong.
</DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>6.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>ISOLATED BITS</B>
<DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>Non-schema set</B> &#151; Names (writes down) or calculates set but is unable to relate it to other sets. May indicate lack or inaccessibility of schema knowledge.
<DD><B>Non-strategy schema</B> &#151; Names or calculates schema, but is unable to connect it to a strategy. Indicates lack of plan and planning ability.
</DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>7.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>HESITANCY</B>
<P>Long idle period (10 secs) with no action. If student successful, indicates lack of automaticity. If student not successful, may also indicate lack of understanding due to failure of problem-solving strategy.
</P>
<DD><B>8.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WILD GOOSE CHASE</B>
<P>Three or more bad schemas connected together as solution strategy.
</P>
<DD><B>9.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>UNUSUAL PATH</B>
<P>Student pursuing highly unusual solution path, one that few people pursue and thus that represents an unusual way of seeing problem. If poor student, this is probably signal of difficulty, lacks understanding, etc.
</P>
<DD><B>10.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>GIVES UP</B>
<P>Student decides to quit or make wild stab at answer without completing solution strategy. If abandoning good strategy, may indicate lack of motivation, self-confidence, effort. If abandoning bad strategy, may indicate reality that cannot obtain answer in reasonable time.
<DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>Promising effort</B> &#151; Gives up before finishing good strategy.
<DD><B>Unpromising effort</B> &#151; Abandons unpromising effort.
</DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>11.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>BAD GOAL (2 SUBTYPES)</B>
<P>Computes set value and declares it as the answer when it is not.
<DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>Premature goal</B> &#151; On correct path, but does not completely finish solution. May implicate lack of self-checking and comprehension-monitoring skills, or ambiguity in problem goal statement. Always implies steps missisng at end.
<DD><B>Bad value</B> &#151; Valid goal set from valid strategy, but value incorrect, perhaps propagated through solution tree.
<DD><B>Bad strategy</B> &#151; Goal derived from bad strategy.
</DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>12.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NEW START</B>
<P>Student begins new schema that is not immediately connected to any tree. Many new starts with few joins (below) may indicate lack of planning, skill, trial-and-error problem solving.
<DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>Same tree</B> &#151; Moves to new part of same solution tree.
<DD><B>Good shift</B> &#151; Abandons unpromising effort, starts anew.
<DD><B>Unnecessary shift</B> &#151; Abandons promising effort.
</DL>
<BR>
<DD><B>13.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>JOINS (COUNT)</B>
<P>Number of times student connects new start to another. Interpret in conjunction with start count, above.
</P>
<DD><B>14.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>TIME EXPIRES</B>
<DD><B>15.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NO EVIDENCE OF CHECKING OR ON-LINE MONITORING</B>
<DL>
<BR>
<DD>Refuses prompted check.
<DD>Conducts unsuccessful checks.
<DD>Other
