<P>Having at our disposal a collection of reduced models determined, with the aid of Propositions 1 and 2, we may formulate the following problem. Assume that a subset K of indices of the set {1,2,&#133;,N} and related inputs are given. Therefore, the following system is known:
</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/05-21d.jpg"></P>
<P>where j &#8712; K. Note that <IMG SRC="images/05-19i.jpg"> for any j &#8712; K and we deal, not with single membership function B<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>, but with an interval-valued fuzzy set, the so-called &#934; fuzzy set.<SUP><SMALL>9</SMALL></SUP> Instead of the two preceding equations, we can introduce a shorthand notation:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/05-22d.jpg"></P>
<P>It is clear that the reduced fuzzy model generates the interval-valued fuzzy set of output. Then, if several input fuzzy sets are available, the relevant outputs forming &#934; fuzzy sets should be combined to get an overall result.
</P>
<P>A reasonable concept to aggregate the results of the reduced models from the subset K would work as follows. For any b<SUB><SMALL>k</SMALL></SUB> &#8712; B, calculate the number of &#934; fuzzy sets contributing to the previously fixed values ranging between zero and card K.</P>
<P>By a simple normalization, we reach a fuzzy set of the second order B; this means that to every b<SUB><SMALL>k</SMALL></SUB> &#8712; B, a fuzzy set defined in [0,1] has been established. More precisely, the value of the membership function B (before normalization) is equal to:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/05-23d.jpg"></P>
<P>for any w &#8712; [0,1], b<SUB><SMALL>k</SMALL></SUB> &#8712; B.</P>
<P>Remembering the main idea behind the concept of model reduction that relies on diverse grades of difficulty and precision while the fuzzy sets of inputs are determined, the fuzzy set B may be modified to take it into account. A level of difficulty to get reliable data of the corresponding input in A<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB> is expressed by u<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>, j &#8712; K; u<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB> is in [0,1]. The higher the value of u<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>, the more severe difficulties are manifested which deal with input determination. The results obtained are less reliable and, in consequence, should not significantly contribute to the final result. The weights u<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB>, j&#8712; K, can be easily obtained, e.g., by the well-known Saaty&#146;s priority method.</P>
<P>This weight factor is useful to control a width of the interval-valued fuzzy set <IMG SRC="images/05-20i.jpg">. Now, instead of the original one, namely, <IMG SRC="images/05-21i.jpg"> one has:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/05-24d.jpg"></P>
<P>where b<SUB><SMALL>k</SMALL></SUB> &#8712; <B>B</B>. We illustrate these stated considerations with the help of a numerical example.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading6"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">V. An Illustrative Example</FONT></H3>
<P>We consider a two-input, single-output fuzzy model <IMG SRC="images/05-22i.jpg">, where n<SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB> = n<SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB> = m = 3 is described by the following fuzzy relation:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/05-25d.jpg"></P>
<P>Construct two reduced fuzzy models making use of the families of the fuzzy sets introduced earlier. Let A<SUB><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUB> be singleton and A<SUB><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUB> be &#147;unknown&#148;.</P>
<P>Then we have for the first and second model, respectively:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/05-26d.jpg"></P>
<P>To visualize how the reduced model works, we consider two input data <IMG SRC="images/05-23i.jpg"> and <IMG SRC="images/05-24i.jpg"> so that:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/05-27d.jpg"></P>
<P>The first reduced model gives an interval fuzzy set:
</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">{[0.3 0.5 0.3], [0.7 0.7 0.7]}</P>
<P>while the second yields:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">{[0.3 0.6 0.4], [0.7 1.0 1.0]}</P>
<P>Their combination, applying the results of Section IV. for &#956;<SUB><SMALL>j</SMALL></SUB> = 1, j = 1,2, lead to the fuzzy set of the second order <IMG SRC="images/05-25i.jpg">, with membership function given by:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/05-28d.jpg"></P>
<P>For comparison, the fuzzy set resulting from the complete model equation <IMG SRC="images/05-26i.jpg"> is equal to [0.7, 0.5, 0.5] and is covered by the fuzzy set B.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading7"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">VI. Conclusions</FONT></H3>
<P>The problem discussed, at length, in this chapter has been addressed to a class of those tasks of verification and improvement properties of the knowledge bases for rule-based expert systems. It has been indicated how the fuzzy relation of the knowledge base can be modified to reach a state of more compact shape yet producing acceptable changes in the control part of the rules. Two general lines of this construction have been underlined, namely, saving reasoning time and preserving the user-friendly property of the expert systems.
</P>
<P>It is also of interest that the algorithms provided here can be applied to pattern recognition schemes, e.g., References 10&#151;12. In this second case the reduction already performed corresponds to a feature selection problem: the changes of control actions find their analogies in an increment of the classification error.</P>
<P>Further studies in this direction can be concentrated for the solution of the reduction problem in the case that the fuzzy relation of the knowledge base is given at a certain precision (i.e., the set of the corresponding fuzzy relation equations has only an approximate solution). In such a situation it would be interesting to discover a set of subcondition candidates that might be eliminated.</P><P><BR></P>
