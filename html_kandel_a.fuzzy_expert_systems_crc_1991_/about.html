<P>This edited volume addresses the specific area of fuzzy expert systems and the choices knowledge engineers and expert systems designers must make to succeed in the field of artificial intelligence. To a large extent the field of uncertainty managment, in general, and fuzzy set theory, in particular, is not driven just by an interest in exploring fuzziness and managing uncertainty in what appears to be a vague and imprecise environment, but also by a practical interest in producing better expert systems and knowledge-based systems. In this book we examine the choices within the context of specific and general purpose fuzzy expert systems.
</P>
<P>In the first chapter Hall and Kandel identify the basic features of the evolution from expert systems to fuzzy expert systems, investigating the different choices provided by fuzziness. The choices here involve deciding how to handle fuzziness by both machines and humans and how to exploit fuzziness at each level of imprecision. Some of these features may not be visible to the user, but they largely determine the performance of a given expert system implementation. Their selection is based on expected performance benefits vs. the complexity associated with their inclusion. The method of handling imprecision in the system leads us through that evolution to fuzzy expert systems.</P>
<P>In Chapter 2, Schneider and Kandel illustrate the evolutionary process described earlier by discussing the design principles of a general purpose fuzzy expert system using fuzzy expected values and fuzzy expected intervals. It is also shown how to use them as an integral part of the fuzzy expert system.</P>
<P>Chapter 3, by Bouchon-Meunier, discusses inferences with inaccuracy and uncertainty in expert systems. This is the first step in the previously discussed evolution. The knowledge base of an expert system may contain uncertainties and inaccuracies. They are either associated with the inference rules given by the experts or deduced from the observation of facts which do not fit exactly the conditions expressed in the premises of the rules. A good tool to cope with these problems is one of the fuzzy implications introduced in fuzzy logics. In this chapter Bouchon-Meunier indicates some reasons supporting the choice of these inferences and the corresponding combination operator.</P>
<P>The representation within the framework of approximate reasoning of relational type rules is illustrated by Yager in Chapter 4. A relational production rule consists of a rule in which one of the antecedent requirements involves the satisfaction of a relationship between two variables. This concept is used by Yager to represent his view of expert systems and the issues involved in some of their trade-offs.</P>
<P>Chapter 5, by Di Nola, Pedrycz, and Sessa, is devoted to the problem of reduction of the knowledge base in rule-based expert systems. The authors first point out that this problem is placed in the main stream of procedures of expert&#146;s knowledge (or its implementation) validation. Subsequently, some algorithms leading to its resolution are given in detail and their complementary character is also underlined. The entire analysis is performed treating the knowledge base in the form of a fuzzy relation, while an inference mechanism is given by means of fuzzy relation equations. This chapter represents, like the previous chapters, important stages in the evolution of expert systems to fuzzy expert systems.</P>
<P>In Chapter 6, Rocha, Giorno, Le&#228;o, and Theoto use a fuzzy automata model to describe neural networks and perform experiments in the acquisition and use of knowledge by experts. This is an interesting attempt to shed light on some of the problems of knowledge engineering and presents a set of ideas concerning theoretic vs. expert knowledge.</P>
<P>Chapter 7 continues the evolutionary exposition via a survey by Sage, putting things in perspective. I felt the need of such a contribution in order to bridge some gaps in the presentation so far. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of recent research into the use of structured information processing frameworks under conditions of imperfect information. By imperfect information, Sage means information that is incomplete, uncertain, imprecise, inconsistent, incoherent, or some combination of all. The central goal of this presentation is the development of conceptual approaches that have ultimate potential for operational implementation as aids to enhance human decision making in a variety of realistic areas through intelligence based support to humans. First, Sage discusses the principal approaches taken. A discussion of research accomplishments is followed by a brief discussion of potential applications of the results.</P>
<P>In Chapter 8, Whalen and Schott deal with linguistic inference and the difficult problems involved in linguistic approximation to determine the linguistic form of the final and intermediate deductions. Basically, this chapter describes FLING, a system which facilitates knowledge acquisition by translating a diagrammatic influence network into an executable knowledge representation for a rule-based, linguistic reasoning system. The cognitively convenient diagrammatic representation can be understood by the domain specialist and improves the communication process for knowledge acquisition. Initially designed for failure diagnosis in a fuzzy network, FLING is extended to represent a generalized transitive digraph.</P>
<P>The first major input to FLING is a definition of the influence network; this consists of a list of nodes, their connecting arcs, and the combining operator for the incoming arcs of each node. The other major input is a list of indicator nodes. The output of FLING is a rule-based system in LISP, compiled from the two major inputs. The inputs to this new system are the user&#146;s linguistic assessments of the specified indicator nodes; its outputs are inferred linguistic assessments of the remaining nodes in the digraph. Depending on where, in the casual chain of the digraph, the indicator nodes fall, the compiled system will operate in diagnosis mode, simulation mode, or a combination of these.</P>
<P>In Chapter 9, Dubois, Lang, and Prade take a fresh look at advances in automated reasoning using possibilistic logic. In the framework of mechanical theorem proving under uncertainty, an extension of the resolution principle to possibilistic logic is proposed; for this purpose they use clauses weighted by a degree which is a lower bound of a necessity or a possibility measure. Two resolution rules are presented. The refutation method is generalized and resolution strategies dealt with. In case where only lower bounds of necessity measures are involved, a semantics is proposed in which the completeness of the extended resolution principle has been proved. Moreover, deduction from partially inconsistent knowledge bases can be managed and displays some forms of nonmonotonicity. The resolution patterns and the refutation strategy presented in this chapter are implemented in a system known as POSLOG (for POSsibilistic LOGic) on a microcomputer.</P>
<P>Kosko&#146;s Chapter 10 concludes the first section of this book &#151; the theory part. In this chapter, Kosko investigates encoding and decoding properties of several fuzzy associative memories (FAMs). A metrical FAM maps arbitrary input patterns into the nearest stored patterns. The author reviews all fuzzy theory concepts used in the analysis. These include new definitions, theorems, and geometrical interpretations of fuzzy entropy, fuzzy subset-hood, and the demarcation of fuzzy theory from probability theory in the context of unit hypercubes and Boolean cubes. Zadeh&#146;s <I>compositional rule of inference</I> is interpreted by Kosko as the operation of a subset FAM where a subset FAM F is sought that stores patterns as fuzzy eigensets. Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs), signed fuzzy digraphs with feedback, are also examined as FAMs by operating on their connection matrix representation. FCMs offer a fuzzy neural network alternative to traditional expert systems. An expert represents his knowledge of some uncertain causal domain by indicating the degree to which variable phenomena, causal concepts, causally increase or decrease each other. The underlying connection matrix is interpreted by Kosko as an FAM network with excitatory and inhibitory causal (synaptic) connections. An FCM inference is a <I>resonant</I> state of causal activity. The resonant state is a <I>hidden pattern</I> among the FCM edges. The hidden patterns presumably represent how the expert would answer different what-if questions (input states). An important task is to decode these limit-cycle hidden patterns. Another task is to combine, arbitrarily, many FCMs, with different causal concepts, given by different experts with varied levels of expertise. This section of the book is concluded with a discussion of the FCM adaptive learning laws and their relations to imprecise expert systems.</P>
<P>The second part of the book, dealing with applications of fuzzy experts systems, begins with Chapter 11, by Hudson and Cohen, who describe the role of approximate reasoning in a medical expert system. The authors developed EMERGE, a rule-based expert system for the analysis of chest pain in an emergency room environment. It was designed to be machine-independent, to provide rapid decision making, and to permit easy replacement of the rule base. EMERGE utilizes certainty factors to indicate the seriousness of the patient&#146;s illness. In this chapter, new techniques are discussed which have been incorporated into the EMERGE system to permit weighting of rule antecedents, indication of the degree of presence of symptoms, and generalization of logical inference techniques.</P>
<P>In Chapter 12, Hall and Kandel develop a methodology for building fuzzy expert systems. The developed methodological theory is applied and the results are embodied in a reusable fuzzy expert system called Fess. Fess is a multi-knowledge source expert system. It may be used to emulate several cooperating experts or any hybrid environment. The knowledge sources are connected by a blackboard architecture which enables them to be loosely coupled. Further, the system has been designed to facilitate the distribution of knowledge sources across several processors. The system may interact with the user in a questioning mode via a simple natural language interface.</P>
<P>In Chapter 13, Mancini and Bandler take a look at environmental design as a very much top-down activity, and consider the mental processes at work in the inception and germination of the <I>grand idea</I> or, more democratically, of a <I>generative kernel</I> of a building task. As both an arrival and a departure, this is, in the authors&#146; opinion, the <I>sine qua non</I> of creative designing. If one accepts that the built form &#151; the aim of the design task &#151; is to be a framework, both physical and psychological, for meaningful experiences, then that task requires a high degree of empathy with the eventual users of the building. The creative designer is one who has lived that built form in advance and has provided this condensed account of it.</P>
<P>The roles of the two modes of psychical activity &#151; the primary and secondary processes &#151; are investigated with the intent of bringing the contribution of the computer to the design development as near as possible to the functioning of the primary process. This contribution is considered in connection with two fundamental and difficult states in the design process: the development and matching of the spatial organization, on the one hand, and the formal visual one, on the other, with the two facets of the kinetic structure of the activities to be housed in the built form.</P>
<P>Chapter 14, by Friedman and Kandel, is devoted to the application of a fuzzy expert system to numerical analysis. In this presentation a two-dimensional fuzzy intelligent differential equation solver is discussed. It can handle 2-D elliptic partial differential equations defined over general domains. The system replaces the domain by a finite element net, which is then used by an intelligent finite element package to solve the problem. The system has been implemented on a network of computers, having the supercomputer CYBER 205 and, later, CRAY YMP as its main numerical tool.</P>
<P>In Chapter 15, L&#243;pez de M&#225;ntaras, Agusti, Plaza, and Sierra introduce a unique approach to the propagation and combination of uncertainty performed by simple accessing of precomputed matrices.</P>
<P>The main objective of this chapter is to describe the MILORD system. MILORD is an expert systems building tool consisting of two inference engines, an explanation module, and a knowledge elicitation module. The system allows the performance of three different calculi of uncertainty on an expert-defined term set of linguistic statements about certainty.</P>
<P>Each calculus corresponds to specific conjunction and disjunction operators. The internal representation of each linguistic statement is a fuzzy interval on the interval [0,1]. The different calculi of uncertainty applied to the elements in the term set give another fuzzy interval as a result. A term from the term set is assigned to the resultant fuzzy interval by means of a linguistic approximation process thereby keeping closed the calculus of uncertainty. One of the main advantages of this approach is that, once the linguistic statements have been defined by the expert, the system computes and stores the matrices corresponding to the different conjunction and disjunction operators for all the pairs of linguistic statements. Therefore, when MILORD is applied, <I>the propagation and combination of uncertainty is performed by simply accessing the precomputed matrices</I>. The knowledge elicitation is based on the Personal Construct Theory of Kelly referenced in the chapter. This methodology elicits the personally relevant conceptual constructs of an expert, over his domain of expertise, through a man-machine dialogue. The constructs are freely chosen by the expert and are the way in which pairs of elements can be described as being either alike to different. From an initial domain and problem-solving specification, the expert&#146;s discriminating constructs and their contrastive set (the linguistic values assigned by the expert when applying the constructs to domain elements) are elicited. This leads to a repertory grid of cross-references between constructs and domain elements. An interactive analysis of the repertory grid is performed in order to:</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>1.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Detect poorly characterized elements
<DD><B>2.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Detect elements that the expert has not yet taken into account.
</DL>
<P>These problems are solved introducing new constructs or elements, respectively. The final result is a personal fuzzy repertory grid that links domain elements with their relevant constructs by means of the linguistic labels of the contrastive set.
</P>
<P>In Chapter 16, Cohen and Hudson address the issue of medical decision making via the use of unmultidimensional polynomials. Automated decision making aids have found numerous applications in medical fields. A number of techniques have been utilized in these systems. In this chapter a method is described which utilizes a class of orthogonal functions in pattern classification. The objective of the method is twofold: to determine correct classification of collections of data and to determine the relative importance of parameters which contribute to the decision. The classification may involve two or more categories. The method is illustrated in a medical application for diagnosis of coronary artery disease using exercise testing. This chapter includes explanation of the use of this technique, to extract information directly from a data base and then combine this information with heuristic rules obtained through expert consultation, to design a prospective decision-making model in the form of an expert system.</P>
<P>In Chapter 17, Hawkes, Derry, and Kandel address the business of producing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) or Intelligent Computer-Assisted Instruction (ICAI) and the techniques that educators and computer implementors must make to succeed in the automated tutoring marketplace.</P>
<P>Chapter 18, by Togai and Watanabe, originated at Duke University, where Togai received his Ph.D. However, Bell Laboratories made possible the implementation of an expert system on a chip. An important factor in this implementation is the work of Togai with a chip person &#151; Watanabe. Between the initial formulation of this <I>fuzzy expert system chip</I> and the final solution are several levels of interesting procedures discussed in detail by the authors.</P>
<P>As shown so far, one of the most difficult research issues in expert systems is the method of coping with uncertainty in the knowledge representation and reasoning process. In Chapter 19, Tzvieli claims that one reason for the unsatisfactory state of affairs is the narrow scope of application of the existing methods. Each system of modeling uncertainty is based on some assumptions (axioms), which do not hold in all circumstances. The contribution of this chapter is in suggesting a <I>formal logical system</I>, in which the assumptions should be made explicit. It is fairly easy, once the logical system is understood, to make the substitutions necessary to tailor a logical system to the circumstances of the application.</P>
<P>Tzvieli&#146;s chapter elaborates on an example of a probability-based logical system PL, in which one assumes that the probabilities, that different formulas are satisfied, are independent of each other. The author proposes a generalization of the logical interpretations of the connectives and quantifiers to this case. The notions of a formula, a structure, assignment, satisfaction, deduction, etc., are generalizations of the corresponding first order ones. A method of assigning semantics to PL is proposed, and consistency, soundness, and completeness of PL are studied. In particular PL is shown to be compatible with the first order predicate calculus.</P>
<P>The last chapter, Chapter 20, by Schneider, Perl, and Kandel, concludes this volume, which has only scratched the surface of the techniques and models associated with delivering a marketable fuzzy expert system. This article demonstrates a fuzzy intelligent autonomous control system that manages the operation of a communication station in a multi-link, multidrop communication network. It accepts the communication request from the operator, assesses the communication conditions on the assigned frequency bands, estimates the predicted performance of the available equipment under the prevailing conditions, operates external sensors to collect and update the various channel conditions, selects the optimal communication mode and frequencies, sets the operating modes of the selected equipment and, finally, performs the communication automatically or via the operator.</P>
<P>The system accepts certain preliminary information from the human operator, from utility programs running on the same processor and from external sensors. These sensors are operated periodically, or as necessary, to update the information concerning channel conditions, network connectivity, and equipment status. The system is an expert system that operates on three distinct knowledge bases in order to reach an optimal solution for the communication problem. It is written in Turbo Pascal and runs on an IBM compatible PC, which functions as the communication station controller.</P>
<P>In summary, this and all other nineteen chapters in this volume will take you through the details pertaining to fuzzy expert systems design and applications. I trust you will find the presentations interesting and useful.</P>
