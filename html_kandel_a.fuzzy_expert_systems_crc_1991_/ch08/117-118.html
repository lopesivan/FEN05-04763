<P>The qualitative assessments of the monetary amounts are not to be viewed as a substitute for or approximation of the actual dollar amounts, but rather as a necessary aid to making sense of the dollars. It is even more important for managerial decision making that a senior manager know whether a particular cost item is &#147;too high&#148; than it is to report the precise dollars-and-cents cost.
</P>
<P>The advantages of an automatic programming approach such as FLING go beyond just reducing the programming labor involved in implementing a decision support system for financial analysts. In the first place, when FLING was validated, using the same network and input set used in FAULT, it detected and exploited a redundancy in the network which was not used in FAULT itself. The FLING-created program could detect when the set of assessments was internally inconsistent in some cases and flag this situation by adding the fuzzy modifier &#147;possibly&#148; to deductions based on conflicting data.</P>
<P>Another advantage is that it is possible to quickly change the list of inputs. When one of the regular inputs is unavailable, FLING can generate a set of rules designed to work around the gap. On the other hand, if extra information becomes available, FLING can write a program to optimally exploit it.</P>
<P>This ability enables a program to work in three modes depending on the list of indicator nodes. When the indicator nodes are all effects, then FLING writes a system which operates in a pure diagnosis mode. When the indicator nodes are all causes, the resulting program is a pure simulation. A mixture of causes and effects, among the designated indicators, results in a mixed simulation/diagnosis system. An example of such a hybrid system is discussed in Section V., &#147;Common Size Analysis&#148;.</P>
<P>Finally, research in the selection and interpretation of financial accounting ratios can be facilitated by trying many different networks in conjunction with real or simulated business data.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading5"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">IV. Demonstration of Network Inference Using Fault</FONT></H3>
<P>The original FAULT model was exercised and validated using the facts from ECOFURN, a published case. The ECOFURN financial data were generated using PAVE,<SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP> a business simulation program developed to support <B>P</B>lanning <B>A</B>nd <B>V</B>aluation of actual business <B>E</B>nterprises. PAVE inputs are a set of detailed assumptions about the firm and its environment. The outputs are projected financial statements of the firm for current and future periods.</P>
<P>Three benchmark data sets were produced via simulation so that FAULT deductions could be compared with a known correct diagnosis. The first stage in generating the FAULT benchmark data was to modify the ECOFURN cast to generate three scenarios. In the first scenario the inputs give the simulated firm operating conditions which are quite favorable (but not absolutely ideal). In the second scenario, the cost of goods sold was higher than in the first and all other inputs were the same. In the third, operating expense was higher and all other inputs were as in the first. PAVE processed each set of inputs, generating three sets of financial statements which differed greatly from each other due to the direct and indirect effects of the different inputs.</P>
<P>In the second stage of the process, the five financial ratios used in FAULT were computed for each of the three scenarios and presented to an expert financial analyst. The expert&#146;s task was to provide verbal judgments of the five ratios in each set, using terms from Wenstop&#146;s<SUP><SMALL>12</SMALL></SUP> quasi-natural language, such as &#147;high&#148;, &#147;very low&#148;, or &#147;upper medium&#148;.</P>
<P>The upper part of Table 2 shows the numeric values and the expert&#146;s linguistic interpretations of the ratios for the first of the three scenarios &#147;near-normal operation&#148;. The lower part of Table 2 shows the results of FAULT deductions from these five linguistic inputs. As expected, nine of the ten line item assessments lie in the range between &#147;upper medium&#148; and &#147;lower medium&#148;, reflecting the smooth operation of this simulated firm. The only exception is a linguistic value of &#147;low&#148; for stock price, which may reflect either an undervalued stock (and, therefore, a very good investment opportunity) or knowledge by investors of some problem outside the scope of this limited financial analysis.</P>
<P>Tables 3 and 2 differ most in regard to the cost of goods sold. The data in Table 3 were generated by increasing the cost of goods sold above the corresponding cost in the first scenario, and FAULT was able to detect this fact by deduction from the expert&#146;s linguistic evaluations of the five ratios. Cost of goods sold is assessed by FAULT as &#147;high&#148;, which explains the assessments of &#147;very low&#148; for gross profit and operating income, and &#147;rather low&#148; for net income. Taxes and interest are removed from consideration as a cause by the assessment &#147;not high&#148;. Since the expert&#146;s input gives no clear indications about operating expenses or tangible assets, these items are assessed as &#147;unknown&#148;. A stock price assessment of &#147;upper upper medium&#148; means the poor performance of the firm has led to an overvalued stock whose price is very likely to fall soon unless management takes corrective action.</P>
<P>The assessment of owner&#146;s equity as &#147;high&#148; and sales as &#147;very high&#148; in Table 3 are somewhat paradoxical. In this context, they do not indicate good news about a firm with booming sales and high retained earnings, but rather bad news about a firm whose meager profits are not living up to what would be expected, based on the level of sales activity and the amount of assets entrusted to it by the owners. (See Section V. for an alternative way of handling these items.)</P><P><BR></P>
