<P>Class three systems all deal with broad domains. Speech is routinely done by people after many years of learning. Research is practiced by skilled people after years of experience through toil. Class three systems attack difficult problems for a nonthinking and learning machine to solve. They will often require multiple knowledge sources. They have difficulty with focus of control. They tend to generate large search spaces. They tend to use a hypothesize, generate, and test form of control. Choosing the correct knowledge sources and then gathering them can be a major chore for these systems. The experts for these systems are not as well defined as in other classes. Uncertainty and information error generally play important roles in class three systems. Currently, uncertainty is not handled in a uniform or optimal manner.
</P>
<P>Class three systems will be the ones that force major innovations to occur in the field of expert systems. They are currently just beyond our reach in terms of solution. They have already brought some important contributions to the field, most notably Hearsay.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading10"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">D. Class Differences and Other Comparison Methods</FONT></H4>
<P>We will now point out some differences between the classes of expert systems that we have discussed. The domains of the systems become larger as you move along the class scale. Expert systems in classes two and three tend to deal with more imprecision than those in class one. The more imprecision inherent in a domain, the worse the class an expert system in that domain to which it will likely belong. The more knowledge necessary for expert system development, the worse the class to which it will generally belong.
</P>
<P>In class three the experts are not as easy to define as in other classes. There is often a lot of interaction with the user, which needs to be smoothed out, in class two. Class one systems tend to be small, focused and not consultation systems. The classes that have been defined provide a snapshot of expert system development. Their characteristics will have meaning in the future, but it is likely to be different from the current.</P>
<P>A good way to compare expert systems individually is to use the activity structures developed by Kohout.<SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP> These structures provide a uniform set of windows into the operation of diverse expert systems. As you examine them in terms of the structure provided and the one we propose, their differences and similarities will become apparent. The information gleaned provides a valid method for a comparison and evaluation of diverse systems. There are six activity structures. They are broken up into two sets of three. One set is known as information handling structures and the other as constraint structures.</P>
<P>The information handling structures deal with the control structure, knowledge structure, and inference structure of the expert system. The constraint structures deal with the protection structures, human-computer interaction structure, and technology-dependent constraints upon the expert system. By applying these structures to expert systems, their strengths and differences become apparent.</P>
<P>In order to completely describe expert systems one other structure should be included. That is an uncertainty handling structure. This structure is contained in all of the other structures, yet is important as a separate entity. Many expert systems deal heavily with imprecision, and the explication of their methods can tell a lot about the usefulness and robustness of the system.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading11"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">III. Suitable Problems for Expert Systems</FONT></H3>
<P>We will summarize the types of problems for which expert systems may currently be the solution. They are certainly the solution for class one problems, which include part of the broad class of control problems. They can solve many large problems which are appropriately restricted. The restriction must rule out areas which involve common sense and analogical reasoning, as well as those that require extensive learning. An expert must be available, and the complexity of the problem must not be extreme in the eyes of an experienced knowledge engineer.
</P>
<P>Expert systems can be useful in limited domains in which there is not a human expert. These include such things as robot activities. An expert system is best applied to problems that have limited domains and well-defined expertise. They are most likely to be accepted in areas that do not require extensive user interaction. As with humans, they work best in environments that do not have a large amount of erroneous and uncertain information in them.</P>
<P>Expert systems are the solution for consultation systems of very limited domains. They are most accepted if they critique the expert&#146;s or practitioner&#146;s conclusions rather than coming to independent conclusions. Explanation facilities, the ease of knowledge acquisition, and making the users feel comfortable with the systems are the major obstacles for consultation systems. It is currently difficult to develop a viable expert system for a dynamic problem area.</P>
<P>In a problem area that appears to be suitable for development, the use of an expert system building tool to provide a prototype for one or two problems will show whether the expert system is appropriate. In the near future, expert systems will be able to handle larger domains and those with a large amount of uncertainty. However, they currently are not useful in the extremes of the two environments just mentioned.</P>
<P>A brief discussion of the problems that currently are not amenable to expert system application will further clarify those that are. Problems that require extensive learning or reasoning by analogy are currently out of reach. Currently, the knowledge about a problem must be easily explicatable by the human expert. We do not yet know how to acquire and adequately represent common sense knowledge. Expert systems are not the solution for problems in the social sciences due to their great complexity and the fact that they are not well modeled. They are often not solvable by human experts and tend to involve a great amount of uncertainty. Problems in meteorology, in which no expert is very precise, do not lend themselves well to expert system development. This indicates that an expert system is not appropriate as we get above a certain amount of uncertainty in our problem area.</P><P><BR></P>
