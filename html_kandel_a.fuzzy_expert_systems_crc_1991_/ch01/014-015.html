<P>Hayes-Roth<SUP><SMALL>18</SMALL></SUP> provides some insight into the problems which are currently beyond the scope of an expert system. We do not know how to reason from first principles, the core set of ideas which generally enable a skilled person to re-create many special cases. We are unable to capture the nonverbal understanding of physical operations that even very young children demonstrate. For instance, we know what will happen when we knock that expensive, fragile vase to the hard floor and we cringe in anticipation as it begins to fall. The effort to put this naive physics knowledge into knowledge-based systems appears extremely large. The representation of meta-knowledge is still weak. Most of our meta-knowledge today is involved in influencing our architectural design. Meta-representation is also lacking. That is, we lack a high level method of uniformly representing our knowledge before it is brought into the formalism appropriate for our application. This means that the wrong representation structure may be chosen, when a structure is not clearly indicated, and has no easy method of recovery.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading12"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">IV. Imprecision in Expert Systems</FONT></H3>
<P>Imprecision is not a big problem in some expert systems domain such as XCON. In a domain with little imprecision a class one expert system can likely be developed. In the domains in which a medium or large amount of imprecision is inherent, the development of an expert system is quite difficult. Therefore, imprecision is an important aspect in the evolution of expert systems.
</P>
<P>There are several sources of imprecision and uncertainty in an expert systems domain. The solution to problems in the domain may be imprecise. For instance, this is true of most medical problems. A solution to a problem may actually be made up of two seemingly separate parts. An expert system must be able to recognize this as well as ways in which solutions may overlap. When a solution is imprecise, it must be presented to the system user in a manner which indicates the uncertainty in it. A composite solution must be skillfully put together and the certainty associated with it made plain when it is presented.</P>
<P>The questions that are asked to determine the solution are often imprecise. An imprecise question will usually lead to an answer which is also imprecise. An expert system must be able to phrase questions in a manner which captures their somewhat vague meanings when they arise. The expert system must also be capable of accepting and providing an interpretation for an answer which contains some uncertainty, and needs to be able to adequately explain its reasoning in the face of the uncertain information which it has gathered.</P>
<P>The process of acquiring knowledge is quite imprecise. It is likely that the knowledge acquired does not exactly capture the expert&#146;s, especially since the expert is often not aware of all the tools he uses in his reasoning process. The knowledge that he reasons with may itself contain uncertainty. This must be effectively captured if we are to emulate the expert&#146;s reasoning process. Typically, the reasoning process of an expert is an imprecise one. We mean that the way in which the knowledge is used to make inferences and decide upon a problem solution is often not a precise process. A reliable methodology is necessary to capture it. As the knowledge engineer captures the reasoning process some variability may also creep in. What the knowledge engineer sees as the reasoning process may not exactly match the true process of the expert. Since the expert is not always aware of the actual reasoning process he uses, the differences may not be discovered. Glaring errors will be found, but the expert system must be capable of successfully recovering from the small inconsistencies which remain.</P>
<P>The knowledge representation language will also introduce some uncertainty into our expert system. This type of imprecision is inherent in our current technology in the following sense. If knowledge is not expressed in some formal language, the meaning cannot be interpreted exactly. Since knowledge engineers have not been able to develop or make universal use of a suitable formal representation language, a knowledge representation scheme must be chosen that appears to adequately capture the knowledge about a problem domain. Since the scheme that is chosen may not provide an exact match of the expert&#146;s knowledge representation, the expert system must be able to deal with this imprecision in a consistent manner. Fuzzy reasoning techniques can provide the basis for representing the imprecision inherent in an expert&#146;s knowledge. It can be used in conjunction with probability theory and Dempster-Shafer evidential theory. If the situation is probabilistic one, a nonfuzzy method would be used.</P>
<P>Some types of problems do not lend themselves to modeling by probability. For example, the case of a statement <I>the age of Joe is about 30</I>, could be modeled as a probability. However, in the fuzzy world it could be modeled by the membership function for <I>about 30</I>. This could give .2/27 + .5/28 + .8/29 + 1/30 + .8/31 + .5/32 + .2/33 with all other ages being outside the set. This could be done with the use of a fuzzy number. It would appear a more natural method of describing such a term.</P>
<P>Incomplete information also adds uncertainty to our system. We cannot always extract all the information that we could use from the user. In this case, we still wish to come to a conclusion if possible. This is true even if the conclusion is less certain. Common sense reasoning about physical life includes many inferences from incomplete information. This is a problem which has only begun to be attacked but appears to fit in with fuzzy reasoning. In any event, an expert system needs to be robust enough to overcome cases in which it has incomplete information. This may be done either by reasoning over, or going around, the gaps in its knowledge. The incorporation of fuzzy techniques in an expert system should allow either of these methods to be applied.</P><P><BR></P>
